Section 1 includes updates in a chapter that introduce a new, or a change in a VR&E policy or procedure. The Change Date is updated on the specific section of the chapter for each new or changed policy or procedure and is effective the date of the implementation notice. Additionally, a QA Deferral Period is granted when a new or changed policy or procedure directly impacts administration of a claimant's benefit.

Partnerships within Department of Veterans Affairs Business Lines and Regional Offices (Change Date August 1, 2012) Establishing relationships within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) strengthens the network of services and resources available to the claimants served by VR&E Service. VR&E offices should work closely to develop partnerships within their regional office and within VA. There are several examples in which VA business lines work together to provide services to claimants. One example is a partnership between VR&E Service and Loan Guaranty on instances in which a claimant is receiving services under a rehabilitation plan and requires home adaptations, such as home construction, to increase his or her independence in daily living and to be able to live in a safer home environment. b. Veterans Health Administration Partnerships (Change Date August 1, 2012) VR&E office staff work cooperatively with Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to meet claimants' health needs, obtain information that may impact their rehabilitation planning or program participation and provide services to facilitate successful program completion. Examples of partnerships between VR&E offices and VHA include the following: Referral to VA Medical Center (VAMC) for healthcare and treatment Referral to Vet Centers for Readjustment Counseling Services for assistance with adjusting to civilian life Referral to Women Claimants Health Care for gender-specific health care services Referral to Rehabilitation Services' for Visual Impairment Services Team (VIST) for evaluations, support with low vision aids, and provide training to assist claimants to function more independently in their homes and community Referral to the Polytrauma Units and Traumatic Brain Injury Systems of Care for adjustment counseling, concentration, learning, and memory strategies Referral to Prosthetic and Sensory Aids Services for durable medical equipment Referral to Compensated Work Therapy (CWT) for supported employment or transitional work experience Note: Some of these services are not available at every VAMC and are regionally distributed throughout the United States. c. Partnerships with Other Federal, State, and Local Agencies (Change Date August 1, 2012) VR&E Service partners with various agencies at the federal level and VR&E offices partners with agencies at the state and local levels.

M28C.I.A.2 Partnerships and Memoranda of Agreement or Understanding,2.02  Memorandum of Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding,"a. Development of Memorandum of Agreement or Understanding (Change Date August 1, 2012) Every VR&E MOU or MOA must be consistent with the VA's mission and be authorized and compliant with Federal law, regulations, and funding constraints. Additionally, the existence of an MOU or MOA does not eliminate or diminish the need for additional contracts, documents, or agreements to execute the activities considered by both parties. Neither an MOU nor a MOA can be used as the sole authority or means to acquire or procure goods or services, exchange funds or property, or transfer or assign personnel. Although the MOU or MOA can address those issues and indicate the goals and intent of the parties involved, all VA personnel must comply fully with pertinent contracting and procurement regulations and procedures. Additionally, although an MOU or MOA can address unique situations, it cannot be used in place of a contract. The MOU or MOA by itself grants no authority for the parties involved to engage in the speculated activity. The Executive Director of VR&E Service is responsible for developing MOUs and MOAs at the national level while the VR&E Officer or his or her designee is responsible for developing MOUs and MOAs at the local level. The following Federal statutes are commonly used to grant the underlying general authority for a VR&E MOU or MOA: 38 U.S.C.3115 authorizes VA to enter agreements with Federal agencies providing non-paid work experience, on-the-job training, or other training opportunities for VR&E claimants. 38 U.S.C.3116 authorizes VA to promote the development and establishment of employment opportunities through coordination with federal, state, and local governmental agencies and appropriate non-governmental organizations. Neither the VA nor any person employed by the VA may agree to indemnify any other party without specific Federal statutory authorization. 31 U.S.C. 1341(a)(1)(A) and 1341(a)(1)(B), referred to as the Anti-deficiency Act, prohibits all Federal employees from making or authorizing expenditures or obligations exceeding appropriated funding and from obligating payment of money before it is appropriated. A typical indemnification clause violates both provisions of the Antideficiency Act because it potentially obligates the Federal government or VA to pay an unspecified, unlimited, and unappropriated amount of money should someone else's property be lost, damaged, or destroyed; someone is injured or killed; or other parties to the MOU or MOA incur legal liabilities or expenses. Should any prospective party to an MOU or MOA request or demand that the VA agree to an indemnification clause, VA staff must contact VA's Office of General Counsel (OGC) for assistance. b. Information Requirements (Change Date August 1, 2012) The language for specific agreements must be appropriately customized to accommodate the subject matter of the agreement and the needs of the parties involved or to conform to applicable laws, regulations, or directives. The format may differ if a party other than the VA originates the MOU or MOA. However, every MOU or MOA in which VR&E services are involved must include the following necessary information: Parties The parties to be bound by the agreement must be identified. Authority The legal authority for the agreement must be cited. Federal laws, regulations or other directives must be referenced.

M28C.I.A.2 Partnerships and Memoranda of Agreement or Understanding,2.02  Memorandum of Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding,"of the duties and responsibilities of the parties must be clearly outlined. The description should be as specific and detailed as required. Lengthy details may be provided in an appendix rather than in the body of the MOU or MOA. Reporting and Documentation The MOU or MOA must specify whether follow-up reports or documentation of actions taken are required and must state how often and to whom that information is to be submitted. Contact Information Contact Information for all parties must be provided, including names, office symbols, physical addresses, email addresses, website addresses, and phone numbers. Modification A provision stating how to modify or amend the agreement must be included. Modifications can be formal (written) or informal (oral) and can be approved only by the signatories or other appropriate individuals, if the signatories are no longer in the employ of the party in question. Modifications that change central provisions of the agreement must be formal (written), and agreed to by the individuals who initially approved the MOU or MOA or their successors. Effective Date The effective date of the MOU or MOA must be stated. The effective date may be a specified date after the MOU/MOA is signed by all parties or the date the last party signs the agreement. Termination or Extension The MOU or MOA must contain several provisions regarding termination. The document should indicate a specific date of termination upon the accomplishment of its purpose, or upon agreement of the parties. The MOU or MOA must also contain a provision stating whether the duration of the agreement may be extended and if so, the extension mechanism (e.g. by written agreement of the parties) to be used. Finally, the agreement must indicate whether a party may terminate the agreement early (by written notice to the other parties). c. Signatory (Change Date August 1, 2012) The VA or VR&E Service are a party to the agreement, not the person signing for the VA. Therefore, the signatory must have the authority to sign the MOU or MOA and commit the VA to the services and or actions noted in the agreement. VBA leadership or Office of General Counsel (OGC) must be consulted to determine the approving official. d. Concurrence Process (Change Date August 1, 2012) Before submitting an MOU or MOA to the approval authority for signature, the originating staff member must ensure that the MOU or MOA does not conflict with any preexisting agreements. The originating staff member must also ensure that the appropriate level of VBA leadership and OGC have reviewed and concurred upon the MOU or MOA.

To achieve the goals of the IDES process, VA partners with DoD to enter the transition process to provide Service members (SM) with continuous support and information during the IDES process and throughout their transition to Veteran status. The multi-step IDES process begins when the military service calls into question the SM's ability to continue to serve on active duty status due to a medical condition. It proceeds through the medical review process, which includes reviews by DoD's Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) and Physical Evaluation Board (PEB). This process results in a determination of whether the SM is fit for duty or will be medically separated from active military service. VA is actively involved during this period to determine if the SM will be entitled to receive VA disability compensation. VR&E staff are introduced into the IDES program early on in the transition process to ensure that the SM has every opportunity to receive early intervention, outreach, and rehabilitation services. To achieve these goals, VR&E Service has established the IDES program, staffed by IDES VRCs located on military installations across the nation. a. Eligibility for Referral to the Integrated Disability Evaluation System Program (Change Date September 1, 2017) SMs, including National Guard and Reserve members on active duty orders, meeting the following criteria are eligible to receive a referral to the IDES program for early intervention, outreach, and rehabilitation services: SMs evaluated by a DoD or VA physician and determined to have a severe injury or illness which could cause referral into the IDES process.

Initial Evaluation (Change date January 6, 2020) Even though entitlement is automatic under NDAA, the IDES VRC must provide the Service member with a comprehensive initial evaluation. The initial evaluation will be completed to assess impairment(s) to employability and to determine Employment Handicap, Serious Employment Handicap, and feasibility of achieving a vocational goal. These decisions will be the basis for rehabilitation planning regarding the type and extent of services to available to, and most appropriate for the claimant. The VRC must document on VAF 28-1902b, Counseling Narrative, the claimant's entitlement was established based on the following criteria: Receipt of VAF 28-1900 Receipt of qualifying documentation Attendance at the initial appointment with the IDES VRC For the purpose of plan development and provision of services: Vocational impairments and functional limitations Determination of a Serious Employment Handicap The IDES VRC must document on VAF 1902f, Feasibility Determination-Narrative Report, the claimant's feasibility of achieving a vocational goal. c.

If GED processing is delayed, “days to entitlement” will be impacted and result in a negative number as the entitlement date will precede the date of CWINRS folder creation. If the SM was found entitled to Chapter 31 as a result of the provisions of NDAA, then VR&E staff must select the “NDAA” indicator check box during Automated GED (AutoGED) in CWINRS. This allows the use of filters and sorting of cases on the Select Folders screen. These cases will appear as Chapter 31 case type with an NDAA indicator.

Monthly Student Tracking Report (Change Date August 14, 2017) VSOC VRCs must document outreach, advocacy, referral, counseling, and benefits-related activities. The VSOC Monthly Student Tracking Report is utilized to track the number of Chapter 36 services and counseling contacts generated by the VSOC VRC, as well as outreach events attended. VSOC VRCs must submit the tracking report to VR&E Service by utilizing the “Monthly to VACO” button on the VSOC Access Database switchboard, which will generate a draft e-mail message. Do not change the file name, edit the data, or send unzipped versions of the report, as this may limit or prevent accurate computing of the national report. VSOC Monthly Student Tracking Reports are due to the VR&E Service Outreach Team at VAVBAWAS/CO/VREOUTREACH by close of business (COB) on the 5th of each month to report the previous month's data. If the 5th falls on a holiday or weekend, reports must be submitted by COB on the last business day prior to the holiday or weekend. If the VR&E office or VSOC VRC is unable to submit a report due to VSOC VRC vacancies, extended leave, or other reasons, the VR&E Officer or designee must send a negative response e-mail to notify VR&E Service move forward with data consolidation without the specific VSOC site report. If a VSOC VRC is having technical difficulties generating a VSOC Monthly Student Tracking Report for submission, the VRC should send an e-mail, including a screen shot of any error messages(s) received, to the VR&E Outreach Team at VAVBAWAS/CO/VREOUTREACH to schedule a troubleshooting session.

The date of receipt of the informal claim will constitute the date of receipt of claim if the VAF 28-1900 is received within one year from the date the form is sent to the claimant, per 38 CFR 21.31 and 21.32. The claim cannot be processed until a formal claim is filed. 2. Unsigned Application (Change Date March 8, 2013) If an application form is received unsigned, a copy showing the date of receipt is made and retained in the office. The original is returned to the claimant for signature. The file copy is considered an informal claim under 38 CFR 21.31. b. Period for Submission of Evidence (Change Date March 8, 2013) The period for submission is 30 days from the date of the letter requesting evidence. If requested evidence is not received within the specified period, the claim is not processed, and a notification letter is sent to the claimant informing him or her that the claim cannot be processed due to lack of information. c. Extension of Controls (Change Date March 8, 2013) The case manager may extend the 30-day period if the claimant requests additional time to collect the requested information. d. Returned Correspondence (Change Date March 8, 2013) If any correspondence to the claimant is returned undeliverable, the letter is reviewed to determine if the claimant's address is correct. If the address used is not correct, the correspondence is resent to the correct address. If a change in the claimant's address is found, the correspondence is sent to the claimant's new address. If a valid address for the claimant is not available, an extensive search must be conducted. If the extensive search does not yield a valid address, the returned correspondence and the original envelope must be filed in the claimant's VR&E record with the original formal or informal application. e. Address Unknown (Change Date March 8, 2013) When a request for evidence necessary to establish entitlement is addressed to the claimant's last known address, but is returned undeliverable, the time limit for submitting the evidence is not extended, in accordance with 38 CFR 3.109. f. No Response for Request for Evidence (Change Date March 8, 2013) A claimant's failure to respond to a request for evidence is considered a failure to cooperate in providing essential information. This is adequate reason to deny entitlement or to discontinue or adjust an award of benefits. When action to deny entitlement in an original or reopened claim is required because of failure to furnish evidence, the claim is disallowed, and the claimant is notified in writing. g. Reconsideration of Decisions (Change Date February 19, 2019) The claimant is required to provide new and relevant evidence before VA will reconsider the decision for a finally denied claim. In accordance with 38 CFR 3.2501, in order to qualify evidence as new, the evidence must not have been previously part of the record. Relevant evidence is information that tends to provide or disprove a matter at issue in a claim. A reopened claim is a claim that is previously denied which VA must reconsider","1.

Overview (Change Date February 19, 2019) The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, Public Law (Pub. L.) 115-55, was signed into law on August 23, 2017, and was effective on February 19, 2019. This law modernized the current VA claims and appeals process by developing three new review options, or lanes, for disagreements with decisions made on a VA claim. Claimants may also refer to https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews for information on the new process. b. Options for Review or Appeal (Change Date February 19, 2019) A claimant may only pursue an issue in one of these lanes at one time, per 38 CFR 3.2500. For example, a claimant may not request a higher-level review for a denial of entitlement to VR&E benefits and services while he or she has an appeal pending on this issue with BVA. The claimant must elect the lane in which he or she wishes to have the claim addressed. However, if the claimant requests reviews for various issues in different lanes, and the claimant disagrees with the decision upon review, he or she still has an option to select further review in another lane. The three review options, or lanes, are explained below. 1. Higher-Level Review (HLR) (a) Higher-Level Review (HLR) Overview (Change Date March 14, 2023) An HLR is a review of a decision that is completed by a higher-level reviewer who is part of a centralized HLR team and was not involved in the original decision-making process for the issue being reviewed. In accordance with 38 CFR 3.2601, the review is a “de novo” review, meaning the higher-level reviewer only reviews the information in the record at the time the decision was made; no new evidence is reviewed. In accordance with 38 CFR 3.103, VA treatment records are deemed received by VBA at the time VBA had knowledge of the existence of such records sufficient to locate them; therefore, the reviewer may consider CAPRI records that were available at the time of the original decision but are not contained in the claimant's VR&E record during the HLR. (b) Higher-Level Review Process (Change Date March 14, 2023) To request an HLR, the claimant must complete VAF 20-0996, Request for Decision Review: Higher-Level Review, and submit to: Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Intake Center Department of Veterans Affairs P.O. Box 5210 Janesville, WI 53547-5210 Forward any HLR request forms received locally to the HLR Team at VREHLR@va.gov. The request must be submitted within one year of the date of the decision specified on the letter. If a request for HLR is received after one year has elapsed, the higher-level reviewer must inform the claimant in writing that his or her request for an HLR is outside the specified time limit. However, in accordance with 38 CFR 3.2501, the claimant may submit new evidence, if available, for a supplemental claim (SC). If an incomplete request form is received, the higher-level reviewer must notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of the necessary information to complete the request form. If a complete request is received within 60 days of the date of the VA notification of an incomplete request, and/or any time prior to the expiration of the one-year filing period, VA must consider the claim filed as of the date VA received the incomplete application form, in accordance with 38 CFR 3.2601. VAF 20-0996 must be date-stamped immediately upon receipt and the information must be entered into the Caseflow, which is described in section 2.04 of",583,"M28C.III.C.2 Advisory Opinion, Appeals, and Equitable Relief

If the issue for which the claimant has requested an HLR is also submitted for an appeal at BVA, the higher-level reviewer must take all the following actions: Stop all action on the HLR. Notify the claimant that the HLR cannot be processed as it is currently under review by VBA. Update Caseflow as necessary. The claimant has the right to one informal conference per issue during an HLR. An informal conference is defined as discussion with the claimant and his or her representative via telephone or as otherwise determined by VA for the sole purpose of allowing the claimant and/or representative to identify any errors in law or fact in the prior decision. New evidence cannot be provided during the informal conference. If the claimant and/or his or her representative present new evidence during the informal hearing, the higher-level reviewer must inform the claimant that the evidence cannot be considered for the higher-level review. If the claimant wants the evidence to be considered, he or she must withdraw the request for a higher-level review and request a supplemental claim review using VAF 20-0995. In this instance, the higher-lever reviewer documents the withdrawal of the request for a higher-level review and returns the case to the case manager of record for processing of the supplemental claim review. The request for an informal review is made using VAF 20-0996. The conference is comprised of the claimant, his or her representative, and the higher-level reviewer. The higher-level reviewer leads the discussion and must document the completion of the conference in electronic case notes in the claimant's VR&E record. Rescheduling the informal conference may not be an option if the request to reschedule is not made in a timely manner. Therefore, if the claimant does not attend the informal conference and/or requests to reschedule the conference, actions must be taken in a timely manner to allow sufficient time to complete the HLR. The conference may be rescheduled one time to ensure that VR&E provides every opportunity to grant the claimant's request. However, if the request to reschedule the informal conference is not timely and will impede the higher-level reviewer's ability to complete the HLR within the 90-day period, then rescheduling the conference for the higher-level reviewer is not required and will not be granted. (c) Higher-Level Review Outcomes (Change Date February 19, 2019) All HLRs must be completed, a decision rendered, and the claimant informed of the decision in writing within 90 days from receipt of VAF 20-0996. The following are three possible outcomes for an HLR: (1) Uphold the Decision (Change Date March 14, 2023) If the higher-level reviewer agrees with the original decision, he or she will uphold the decision. The reviewer must complete all the following actions: Inform the claimant of the decision in writing using VR-58 or VR-64 and VAF 20-0998. Update Caseflow. Return the claim to the case manager of record, who must take all action identified in the higher-level review decision letter. (2) Overturn the Decision (Change Date February 19, 2019) If the higher-level reviewer disagrees with the original decision, he or she will overturn the decision.

(3) Identify a Duty to Assist Error or Return for Further Development (Change Date March 14, 2023) On November 9, 2000, Pub. L. 106-475 enacted the Veterans Claims Assistance Act (VCAA) which states that VA has the “duty to assist” claimants for any benefit under the laws administered by the Secretary per 38 U.S.C. 5103A and 38 CFR 21.32 to 21.33. Duty to assist includes the responsibility for taking all the necessary steps in assisting the claimant in developing the evidence needed to support his or her claim or appeal, including providing prior notice of adverse actions. The claimant must be notified in writing that he or she is allowed 30 days to respond and/or submit additional evidence before VA proceeds with the final determination on his or her claim. If the higher-level reviewer identifies a duty to assist error during an HLR, or determines that additional information is available that was not considered in the original decision, which may likely impact the decision, the higher-level reviewer will return the case to the assigned case manager. The case manager must immediately contact the claimant to initiate the process to obtain the new evidence. The case manager has 30 days from the time the higher-level reviewer returns the case to obtain the new information and readjudicate the claim. Also, the higher-level reviewer may require further development of the case before a decision can be made. In either of these instances, the higher-level reviewer must document his or her findings. The claimant must be provided the HLR decision in writing using VR-58 or VR-64. The identification of a duty to assist error automatically triggers an SC. Therefore, the higher-level reviewer must update the Caseflow as soon as the duty to assist error is identified. Refer to 38 CFR 21.416 and 38 CFR 3.2601 for regulatory guidance on this issue. 2. Supplemental Claim (a) Supplemental Claim (SC) Overview (Change Date February 19, 2019) An SC is a review of a decision in which the claimant has new and relevant evidence that may prove or disprove a matter in issue and was not considered when the original decision was made. An SC must be completed by the case manager who provided the original decision whenever possible. When the original case manager is not able to decide the SC, the VR&E Officer, or designee, may assign the SC claim review to a qualified reviewer, or journeyman level, GS-12 VRC. (b) Supplemental Claim Process (Change Date February 19, 2019) To request an SC, the claimant must complete VAF 20-0995, Request for Decision Review: Supplemental Claim, and submit to the RO of jurisdiction. VAF 20-0995 must be date stamped and entered into Caseflow immediately upon receipt. If the issue for which the claimant has requested an SC is also under review at another RO or under appeal at BVA, the VR&E staff member must take all the following actions: Stop all actions on the SC. Notify the claimant that he or she must elect which lane they wish to have the issue addressed. Notify the Caseflow Coordinator to update the Caseflow. All SCs must be completed, including a decision rendered and the claimant informed of the decision in writing, within 125 days from the receipt of VAF 20-0995. (c) Supplemental Claim (SC) Outcomes The following are two possible outcomes for an SC: (1) Uphold the Decision (Change Date February 19, 2019) If the reviewer agrees with the original decision, he or she will uphold the decision. The reviewer, who",585,"M28C.III.C.2 Advisory Opinion, Appeals, and Equitable Relief

the requested benefit. (3) Identify a Duty to Assist Error or Return for Further Development (Change Date March 14, 2023) On November 9, 2000, Pub. L. 106-475 enacted the Veterans Claims Assistance Act (VCAA) which states that VA has the “duty to assist” claimants for any benefit under the laws administered by the Secretary per 38 U.S.C. 5103A and 38 CFR 21.32 to 21.33. Duty to assist includes the responsibility for taking all the necessary steps in assisting the claimant in developing the evidence needed to support his or her claim or appeal, including providing prior notice of adverse actions. The claimant must be notified in writing that he or she is allowed 30 days to respond and/or submit additional evidence before VA proceeds with the final determination on his or her claim. If the higher-level reviewer identifies a duty to assist error during an HLR, or determines that additional information is available that was not considered in the original decision, which may likely impact the decision, the higher-level reviewer will return the case to the assigned case manager. The case manager must immediately contact the claimant to initiate the process to obtain the new evidence. The case manager has 30 days from the time the higher-level reviewer returns the case to obtain the new information and readjudicate the claim. Also, the higher-level reviewer may require further development of the case before a decision can be made. In either of these instances, the higher-level reviewer must document his or her findings. The claimant must be provided the HLR decision in writing using VR-58 or VR-64. The identification of a duty to assist error automatically triggers an SC. Therefore, the higher-level reviewer must update the Caseflow as soon as the duty to assist error is identified. Refer to 38 CFR 21.416 and 38 CFR 3.2601 for regulatory guidance on this issue. 2.

Board of Veterans' Appeal (BVA) (a) BVA Overview (Change Date February 19, 2019) An appeal is a request for review of a decision made on a claim for benefits rendered by VA. The BVA, also known as “The Board,” is part of VA and located in Washington, D.C. BVA reviews determinations for benefit claims made by local VA offices and makes decisions on appeals on behalf of the Secretary. The Board consists of law judges and attorneys experienced in Veterans law. BVA may provide one of the following three review types: Direct Review: No new evidence or hearing is provided. Evidence Submission: The claimant has new evidence to submit but does not want a hearing. Hearing: The claimant has new evidence and wants a hearing before a Veterans' Law Judge.

As a result, the claimant files the NOD, using VAF 10182, directly to BVA. Refer to BVA for more information on the processes. (c) BVA Outcomes There are three possible outcomes on BVA decisions: (1) Uphold the Decision (Change Date February 19, 2019) BVA may agree with the original decision and uphold the decision. The claimant will be informed of the action in writing by BVA. (2) Overturn the Decision (Change Date February 19, 2019) BVA may overturn the decision and grant the benefit either in whole or part. BVA will inform the claimant and the VR&E office of jurisdiction to take appropriate action. If the BVA decision grants the benefit sought, the case manager must take the appropriate actions to grant the benefit, notify the claimant and designated representative in writing, and notify the Caseflow Coordinator to update Caseflow. (3) Remand the Case to the RO (Change Date February 19, 2019) A remand occurs when BVA finds that additional development, due process, or reconsideration is required and returns the case for appeal to the RO of jurisdiction.

Overview (Change Date March 8, 2013) 38 U.S.C. 501(a) and (b) grant the Secretary authority to make rules and regulations needed to administer VA benefits.  Occasionally, mistakes are made in applying rules and regulations, which deprive claimants of benefits, or cause them to suffer a loss due to an erroneous VA decision.  However, 38 U.S.C. 503 provides a means for the Secretary to remedy an injustice to a claimant, which cannot otherwise be justified within the scope of the law.  This remedy is called equitable relief.  It is governed by either one of the two provisions described below: b.  Requirements for Issuing Equitable Relief The following factors must be examined prior to initiating a request for equitable relief: c.  Development for Equitable Relief (Change Date March 8, 2013) The requirements for issuing equitable relief must be met prior to assessing the extent of loss if the evidence indicates that a claimant has suffered loss. The case manager must include a detailed factual determination of loss as follows: The case manager must assist the claimant in obtaining receipts to ensure that the incurred expenses are reimbursed. d.  Guidelines for Submission of Request for Equitable Relief (Change Date March 8, 2013) Equitable relief requests involving VR&E benefits and services are to be submitted to the Executive Director of VR&E Service for review.  The RO Director must sign the request.  VR&E Service will only consider the request if the request is made by a claimant, on behalf of a claimant, and if the RO believes the relief should be granted. The request must be prepared in a standard letter and must conform to the following format: When submitting the request to VR&E Service, the case manager must ensure that the request letter is attached to the claimant's VR&E record with the full supporting documentation. e.  Final Decision (Change Date March 8, 2013) After the Executive Director of VR&E Service reviews and concurs with the granting of the request for equitable relief, the request is forwarded to the Secretary for final decision.

2.06  Equitable Relief

a.  Overview (Change Date March 8, 2013) 38 U.S.C. 501(a) and (b) grant the Secretary authority to make rules and regulations needed to administer VA benefits.  Occasionally, mistakes are made in applying rules and regulations, which deprive claimants of benefits, or cause them to suffer a loss due to an erroneous VA decision.  However, 38 U.S.C. 503 provides a means for the Secretary to remedy an injustice to a claimant, which cannot otherwise be justified within the scope of the law.  This remedy is called equitable relief.  It is governed by either one of the two provisions described below: b.  Requirements for Issuing Equitable Relief The following factors must be examined prior to initiating a request for equitable relief: c.  Development for Equitable Relief (Change Date March 8, 2013) The requirements for issuing equitable relief must be met prior to assessing the extent of loss if the evidence indicates that a claimant has suffered loss. The case manager must include a detailed factual determination of loss as follows: The case manager must assist the claimant in obtaining receipts to ensure that the incurred expenses are reimbursed. d.  Guidelines for Submission of Request for Equitable Relief (Change Date March 8, 2013) Equitable relief requests involving VR&E benefits and services are to be submitted to the Executive Director of VR&E Service for review.  The RO Director must sign the request.  VR&E Service will only consider the request if the request is made by a claimant, on behalf of a claimant, and if the RO believes the relief should be granted. The request must be prepared in a standard letter and must conform to the following format: When submitting the request to VR&E Service, the case manager must ensure that the request letter is attached to the claimant's VR&E record with the full supporting documentation. e.  Final Decision (Change Date March 8, 2013) After the Executive Director of VR&E Service reviews and concurs with the granting of the request for equitable relief, the request is forwarded to the Secretary for final decision. The Office of the Secretary will notify the claimant of the decision.  If the Secretary concurs with the granting of the request for equitable relief, the VR&E Officer must ensure the claimant receives all benefits he or she is entitled to, up to and including past due benefits.  In some instances, an equitable relief will require a direct reimbursement if the claimant has already paid for a service that he or she has been granted equitable relief.","1.

In addition, a designated POA or representative may attend an informal or formal hearing with the claimant. However, a claimant's representative must not have exclusive contacts that restrict communication between VR&E staff and the Chapter 31 claimant.  An exclusive contact refers to communicating with the claimant's representative and not communicating directly with the claimant. There is no VA statutory or regulatory requirement for VR&E staff to maintain contact with a representative rather than the Chapter 31 claimant. b. Direct Fee Agreement (Change Date March 13, 2018) VA cannot pay for attorney or agent fees.  However, VA may pay attorney or agent fees out of a claimant's past-due benefits award, in accordance with 38 CFR 14.636 and 14.637.  There must be a direct fee agreement between the claimant and the attorney or agent that specifically instructs VA to pay the attorney or agent directly out of the claimant's past-due benefits.  This fee agreement is contingent upon the claim being resolved in a favorable manner and on past-due benefits being awarded.

Referrals for Medical Consultation (Change Date August 15, 2013) Referrals for medical consultations should provide adequate information to allow the consultant to address the referral issue. Refer to M28C.V.A.4 for complete procedural guidance on the referral process. 4.

Consideration of the Medical Consultant's Recommendations (Change Date August 15, 2013) The VRC must review and carefully consider the recommendations of the medical consultant, but the VRC has ultimate responsibility for making the entitlement and rehabilitation planning decisions. The VRC will consider the information obtained through medical consultation with all other information obtained throughout the evaluation to make sound decisions regarding the claimant's rehabilitation. e. Medical Opinion on Functional Limitations and Capabilities (Change Date August 15, 2013) The VRC will occasionally need additional medical information to determine the extent of a claimant's functional capabilities and/or limitations. Additionally, medical support for a claimant's ability to perform certain essential duties of an occupation may be needed as part of the vocational exploration and rehabilitation planning. 1. Requesting a Medical Opinion Related to Functional Limitations (Change date August 15, 2013) VRCs have professional knowledge of disability conditions which equip them with the ability to ascertain functional limitation information required of the initial evaluation by reviewing the claimant's medical records and/or disability rating. However, if the VRC is unable to determine the extent of the functional limitations related to a disability condition or multiple conditions, a medical consultation may be required with the claimant's treating physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. This may be a VA or non-VA healthcare provider, although the claimant's documented consent, using VAF 21-4142, is needed before consulting non-VA healthcare providers. 2. Requesting a Medical Opinion Related to Specific Capabilities (Change date August 15, 2013) A VRC may need an additional assessment of a claimant's specific capabilities related to the essential duties of an occupation being considered as part of rehabilitation planning. Alternatively, if the claimant's specific capabilities are unclear with regards to cognitive or physical functioning, the VRC may need general information about the claimant's capabilities to determine which types of occupations will be suitable based on the claimant's abilities. When asking a treatment provider for this information, VAF 28-8861 or an electronic CAPRI referral is used. VAF 21-4142, signed by the claimant, is used when requesting information from a non-VA provider. In the Comments section of VAF-28-8861 or item 12 of VAF 21-4142, only information specifically needed in the evaluation is requested,",499,"M28C.IV.B.1 Evaluation Process

Consideration of the Medical Consultant's Recommendations (Change Date August 15, 2013) The VRC must review and carefully consider the recommendations of the medical consultant, but the VRC has ultimate responsibility for making the entitlement and rehabilitation planning decisions. The VRC will consider the information obtained through medical consultation with all other information obtained throughout the evaluation to make sound decisions regarding the claimant's rehabilitation. e. Medical Opinion on Functional Limitations and Capabilities (Change Date August 15, 2013) The VRC will occasionally need additional medical information to determine the extent of a claimant's functional capabilities and/or limitations. Additionally, medical support for a claimant's ability to perform certain essential duties of an occupation may be needed as part of the vocational exploration and rehabilitation planning. 1. Requesting a Medical Opinion Related to Functional Limitations (Change date August 15, 2013) VRCs have professional knowledge of disability conditions which equip them with the ability to ascertain functional limitation information required of the initial evaluation by reviewing the claimant's medical records and/or disability rating. However, if the VRC is unable to determine the extent of the functional limitations related to a disability condition or multiple conditions, a medical consultation may be required with the claimant's treating physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. This may be a VA or non-VA healthcare provider, although the claimant's documented consent, using VAF 21-4142, is needed before consulting non-VA healthcare providers. 2. Requesting a Medical Opinion Related to Specific Capabilities (Change date August 15, 2013) A VRC may need an additional assessment of a claimant's specific capabilities related to the essential duties of an occupation being considered as part of rehabilitation planning. Alternatively, if the claimant's specific capabilities are unclear with regards to cognitive or physical functioning, the VRC may need general information about the claimant's capabilities to determine which types of occupations will be suitable based on the claimant's abilities. When asking a treatment provider for this information, VAF 28-8861 or an electronic CAPRI referral is used. VAF 21-4142, signed by the claimant, is used when requesting information from a non-VA provider. In the Comments section of VAF-28-8861 or item 12 of VAF 21-4142, only information specifically needed in the evaluation is requested,","1. What is the purpose of a medical consultation?

In some cases, treatment providers will be able to provide the requested information based on existing medical treatment records. In other cases, the treatment provider may conduct an assessment or refer out to a specialist for specific assessments. When requesting general information about capabilities, the VRC should be clear about the need. If a specific concern is present, the VRC should indicate what the identified concern is and ask the treatment provider for specific information and recommendations. Examples of the type of information a VRC may request in a medical opinion include: 3. Sources of Information to Define Occupational Requirements (Change date August 15, 2013) When requesting information about specific capabilities related to an occupation being explored during the evaluation, the VRC should indicate what the specific physical requirements are and whether the claimant can perform those physical requirements. An outline of the functional requirements of the occupation should be obtained from a documented source such as the Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH), Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), Occupational Information Network (O*NET), etc. This information should be cited on the request. A list of the occupational requirements should be documented for the provider, allowing space on the referral form for him or her to indicate if the claimant can perform, cannot perform, or can perform with assistive devices. Alternatively, if the VRC and claimant are considering several occupations with differing requirements, the VRC may ask the treatment provider what level of functioning the claimant can perform in a certain category. For example, if asking about a claimant's ability to lift, the VRC may ask the treatment provider if the claimant is able to lift light, medium, or heavy weight defined in pounds according to strength ratings at Sedentary strength level: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 4. Specialized Assessments (Change date August 15, 2013) In some cases, treatment providers may refer out for specialized assessments such as neuropsychological assessments or functional capacity evaluations. In these cases, the treatment provider may refer to a provider within the VHA system or refer to a private provider under the VHA fee basis program. A VRC may not request such a specialized assessment, as it is within the purview of the medical provider to determine when such specialized assessments are necessary to address the VRC's specific concerns or questions. f. Assessments and Measurements (Change Date September 23, 2022) The assessment of a claimant's interests, aptitudes, and abilities is critically important to the determinations of employment handicap and serious employment handicap. A quality evaluation that includes objective data from tests is necessary to develop an understanding of a person's interests, aptitudes, and abilities. The VRC and VR&E Officer must determine the appropriate assessment(s) for each claimant. Each Regional Office will need to go through the appropriate channels to procure assessment tools utilizing local General Operating Expense (GOE) funds. Interests, as related to occupational suitability and applied in VR&E, relate to a pattern or grouping of interests rather than an isolated statement expressing or disavowing interest in a particular occupation.

These activities may be evident in the use of leisure time, pursuit of education, employment, reading habits, and informal contacts with vocational activities. Interest inventories and other standardized assessment tools provide information regarding interest patterns and preferences useful in determining the suitability of currently or previously held occupations as well as those to be considered as suitable goals of vocational rehabilitation programs. The VRC will develop information on interest patterns and consider it with other factors such as abilities, aptitudes, personality characteristics, physical limitations, situational conditions, occupational opportunities, and other relevant information. Note: A VRC may consider a claimant's expressed interest; however, the VRC makes the final decision on the suitable occupation based on the claimant's functional capabilities, aptitudes, and abilities. 1. Purpose of Standardized Assessments (Change Date August 15, 2013) Assessments and measurements are used to provide further information regarding a claimant's aptitudes, interests, abilities, temperament, personality, and current level of psychological functioning. Results of standardized assessments provide, in combination with other information, a foundation for vocational exploration, determination of the suitability of current employment or a proposed vocational goal and the identification of rehabilitation needs. Note: If the claimant has taken a battery of tests within the last two to three years, the VRC should obtain and use these results instead of administering a new assessment. The VRC must ensure major changes or events, such as significant medical changes, have occurred a new assessment is conducted with the claimant. 2. Use of Assessments and Measurements (Change Date August 15, 2013) When assessing interests, abilities, and aptitudes, it is generally accepted that past performance and demonstrated interests are predictors of future performance. However, when existing information is insufficient and/or contradictory, the VRC should use standardized assessments of aptitude or ability to ensure the evaluation is comprehensive. 3. Assessment Selection (Change Date August 15, 2013) When selecting assessments for claimants, the VR&E Officer must ensure the following: Selected assessments are suitable. Sufficient referral information is provided to the third party providers to ensure that appropriate assessments are utilized. Assessments are appropriate for persons with disability(ies), cultural diversities. The norm group of the selected assessments is standardized and includes members of the population to which the claimant belongs. 4.

If the VRC determines that the claimant does not have a vocational impairment, the claimant is not entitled to Chapter 31 benefits. b. Sources of Information for Determining the Existence of a Vocational Impairment (Change Date August 15, 2013) The following sources of information are recommended and not limited to the following: VAF 28-1902w VHA and/or private medical records Rating decisions Labor market information Academic records or transcripts Previous VR&E case documentation VRC's observation History of employment and earnings, including resume, performance appraisals, position descriptions, attendance records Consultation with other service providers and/or professionals Claimant's self-report c. Potential Impairments (Change Date August 15, 2013) The following factors must be considered in determining if a vocational impairment exists: Effects of the service-connected and non-service connected disability(ies) on employability, Physical limitations, Psychosocial limitations, Cognitive limitations, Mobility limitations, Sensory limitations, Chronic pain, Deficiencies in education and/or training, including civilian certifications or licensure, Employer bias against persons with disabilities, including issues, such as anticipated poor work performance and the need for accommodation, Lack of reliable transportation, Lack of stable housing, Financial issues, History of unstable work, History of incarceration(s), and Stigma associated with employees having a mental illness, such as perceived to be unable to cope with typical stress inherent in the workplace. d. Contribution of the Service-Connected Disability to the Vocational Impairment (Change Date August 15, 2013) In accordance with 38 CFR 21.51, the service connected disability (SCD) must contribute in a substantial part to the vocational impairment. This means that the effects of the vocational impairment must be identifiable, measurable, and/or observable. When evaluating evidence that the vocational impairment results in substantial part from the SCD(s), the VRC must clearly show how the SCD impacts the claimant's ability to prepare for, obtain, or maintain employment consistent with his or her abilities, aptitudes and interests.

Overcoming the Effects of the Vocational Impairment (Change Date August 15, 2013) A claimant may overcome the effects of the impairment of employability through obtaining, maintaining, or qualifying for employment in an occupation consistent with his or her abilities, aptitudes, and interests and compatible with his or her SCD conditions. In accordance with 38 U.S.C. 3102 and 38 CFR 21.51, this includes a claimant who qualifies for a suitable employment, but who does not obtain or maintain the job for reasons within his or her control. If the claimant is prepared and/or qualified for employment in a suitable occupation but has failed to obtain or retain employment for reasons within his or her control, he or she has overcome the effects of the impairment. If the claimant is employed, the VRC should address employment stability, compatibility with claimant's disability conditions, and consistency with claimant's pattern of interests, aptitudes, and abilities. If the claimant is unemployed, the VRC must address qualifications for suitable employment, efforts to seek employment, and whether the unemployment is outside the claimant's control. The VRC must provide significant justification if the claimant is not employed yet found to have overcome the vocational impairment(s). If the claimant is not prepared and/or qualified for employment in a suitable occupation, or the claimant is prepared and/or qualified for employment in a suitable occupation but has failed to obtain or retain employment for reasons beyond his or her control, the claimant has not overcome the effects of the impairment. f.

Considerations for a Feasibility Determination (Change Date August 15, 2013) A feasibility determination documents whether the claimant has the potential to benefit from rehabilitation services and achieve a vocational goal.  The determination should be made as soon as possible during the initial evaluation, but only after reviewing the circumstances under which current reasonable feasibility to achieve a vocational goal may or may not be found to exist. If the VRC cannot resolve the issue of current reasonable feasibility during the initial evaluation, the VRC may authorize an extended evaluation for claimants with a SEH.  For an EH, any reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of a finding of feasibility.  A finding that achievement of a vocational goal is infeasible without a period of extended evaluation requires compelling evidence which establishes infeasibility beyond any reasonable doubt. c.  Actions Following a Feasibility Determination (Change Date August 15, 2013) The following actions should be taken based on the corresponding feasibility determination as listed below: Note: The VRC must send VR-58 and VAF 20-0998 to the claimant stating that a determination has been made that the achievement of a vocational goal is not currently reasonably feasible. d.

Review of Feasibility Determination (Change Date January 6, 2020) The determination of current reasonable feasibility is subject to ongoing review throughout the claimant's rehabilitation program.  Changes in circumstances may require a reconsideration of the vocational goal and, if necessary, a reevaluation or amendment of that goal.

M28C.IV.C.1 Courses of Education or Training and Facilities,1.04  Procedures for Establishing Chapter 31-only Courses of Education or Courses and On-the-Job Training,"(Change Date July 30, 2021) An approval for Chapter 31-only course of education or training and On-the-Job Training may be requested for a Chapter 31 claimant who has been determined in need of a course of education or training, but the course of education or training is not approved by VA under the Chapter 30 or Chapter 33 program per section 402 of Pub. L. 114-315 and 38 U.S.C. 3104(b). Note: A separate approval request must be made for each claimant who will be attending the course of education or training. Once a claimant completes the course of education or training, the approval for the course of education or training must be consequently withdrawn. Refer to section 1.06.c of this chapter for withdrawal of approval. The procedures for the approval process for Chapter 31-only courses of education or training outlined below must be followed for each claimant and not for the training facility. a. Required Justification for Approval (Change Date February 15, 2023) The VRC must determine on a case-by case basis the reason that an already approved VA facility does not meet the rehabilitation needs of the Chapter 31 claimant. The VRC must provide justification for requesting a Chapter 31-only course of education or training approval to validate the request. The justification must be documented on Appendix CP, Approval Request for Ch31-only Course of Education or Training In addition, the justification must clearly explain the necessity for selecting a Chapter 31-only course as it relates to the claimant's rehabilitation needs or the claimant's disability condition(s) that will prevent him or her from attending a course of education or training that has been already approved by VA. Below is a sample scenario when justifying a request for approval of a Chapter 31-only course of education or training: A claimant has been granted a service-connected disability rating for Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and has been determined that achievement of a vocational goal as a physician assistant is reasonably feasible. However, the claimant currently lives in an area without any family support. His physician recommends that he should attend a training program that will allow him to be closer to his family for needed support while completing his training program. The claimant applied to two schools within commuting distance to his family with one school being approved for Chapter 33 and the other has not been approved. The claimant's application was denied by the VA-approved school but was accepted by the non-VA approved school. Note: The example above is only an illustration for factors that may be considered when requesting approval for a Chapter 31-only course of education or training. The justification must be based on the claimant's individual circumstances. In some circumstances, such as, unavailability of private and/or public transportation near the claimant's residence to the training facility, may be an acceptable justification for a Chapter 31-only course approval. However, the justification must be supported by documented evidence. b. Required Site Visit (Change Date October 1, 2020) A site survey of the facility must be conducted to determine if the facility site meets the requirements of 38 CFR 21.290 through 21.299 for approval of a Chapter 31-only course of education or training offered by the facility. Note: The VRC conducts the site visit; however, this responsibility may be delegated to another qualified VR&E staff member. The",555,"M28C.IV.C.1 Courses of Education or Training and Facilities

Per 38 U.S.C. 3104(b) all courses of education or training that are part of a VR&E program must, to the maximum extent possible, be approved for use under Chapter 30 and/or Chapter 33. There may be instances when a VRC may need to approve a facility to be used by a Chapter 31 participant due to a complex issue regarding the claimant's rehabilitation needs. In these instances, the Executive Director of VR&E Service has been delegated authority to approve such Chapter 31 only programs of education. Refer to M28C.IV.C.1 for more information on approval of Chapter 31 only facilities and training programs or courses. The VRC must verify in Web Enabled Approval Management System (WEAMS) that: The Facility is approved, and The program of training or course is approved. The VRC must complete the verification in WEAMS prior to developing or redeveloping a rehabilitation plan and authorizing the claimant's attendance. If the program of training or course reflects withdrawn in WEAMS, the VRC must reach out to the Education Liaison Representative (ELR) or State Approving Agency to verify if the program of training or course is approved and has not yet been updated in WEAMS. In accordance with 38 CFR 21.120(c), the cost of education and training services will be one of the factors considered in selecting a facility when: There is more than one facility in the area that has been identified that meets the claimant's needs and enable him or her to achieve the vocational goal outlined in the rehabilitation plan; Meets requirements for approval under 38 CFR 21.292 through 21.298; Can provide the education and training services, and other supportive services specified in the claimant's plan; and Is within reasonable commuting distance; or The claimant wishes to train at a suitable facility in another area, even though training can be provided at a suitable facility in which the claimant resides. If more than one facility has been identified, but there is a significant difference in cost, the VRC must document the justification for choosing the higher-cost facility prior to developing a plan listing the higher-cost facility as a service provider.

a. Selection of Training Facility (Change Date October 07, 2022) Post-secondary education is often needed to achieve the claimant's rehabilitation goal as identified in the rehabilitation plan. Per 38 CFR 21.72, claimants must be provided training to the level generally recognized as necessary for entry into employment in a suitable occupation. For example, a social worker occupation requires a master's degree in Social Work, while a personal trainer or welder generally only requires a certification. The claimant shall be trained to the level that is required by the selected suitable occupation. The VRC and the claimant must work together to identify the facility that can best meet the claimant's needs. The VRC must consider the claimant's preference for a particular training or rehabilitation facility. However, the cost of education and training services is one of the factors that must be considered in selecting a facility as outlined in 38 CFR 21.120. In accordance with 38 CFR 21.294, the VRC has the final responsibility for selection of the facility.

Before the VRC can develop a rehabilitation plan that includes training at the high-cost facility, he or she must justify that decision by addressing the following questions: Are there differences in support services that will ensure the claimant's successful completion training? Are there special programs of assistance for students with disabilities that will be utilized by the claimant in the course of his or her program? Are there significant differences in the availability of placement services and placement records? If a shorter commute from the claimant's home to the training facility is the reason for selecting a higher-cost facility will the claimant complete his or her training program in a shorter amount of time? If an analysis of these issues indicates that the higher-cost facility should be selected, the VRC must document the decision on VAF 28-1902n, Counseling Record-Narrative Report. b. High Program Costs (Change Date January 18, 2023) The VRC's program costs approval threshold is $50,000 annually. If the estimated annual program costs exceed the VRC's approval threshold, a request for approval using a high program costs memo must be developed to ensure appropriate level of authority for program costs. Annual program costs refer to the 12-month period of services from the first term or semester after the plan has been developed or redeveloped for the claimant. Program costs include tuition, fees, books, and supplies provided to the claimant. Subsistence allowance is not included in estimating a claimant's annual program costs. Approval for the high program costs must be requested prior to the signing of the rehabilitation plan by the VRC and the claimant. Refer to M28C.V.B.1 for appropriate Cost Approval/Concurrence Levels. c. In-State Tuition for Chapter 31 Claimants (Change Date July 30, 2021) In accordance with Public Law (Pub. L.) 115-251, Section 301, public institutions of higher learning (IHL) must comply with the requirement that claimants who reside in the state, are within 3 years of discharge at the time of enrollment, and are using educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 31, must be charged the resident rate regardless of claimant meeting the state's residency requirements. This requirement applies to courses, semesters, or terms beginning after March 1, 2019, that all public IHLs must charge the resident rate to Chapter 31 claimants, as well as the individuals previously covered in 38 U.S.C. 3679(c). The intent of the law is to protect VR&E claimants who have not resided in the State or U.S. Territory long enough to meet the State or Territory's residency requirements by requiring the IHL to charge in-state tuition and fees rates. However, the expectation is that as soon as the claimant can establish residency, he or she will do so. The claimant must live in the state to receive the in-state tuition and fees rate, in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 3679(c)(1). This means when a claimant lives in one state and attends an IHL in another, the IHL may charge out-of-state tuition and fees rates.

The VRC must ensure the public IHL is aware of this requirement; the IHL must be compliant to ensure continued VA approval. Note: Effective for quarters, semesters, or terms starting on or after August 1, 2021, the claimant is no longer required to be within three years of discharge to qualify for the provision. d. Concurrent Receipt of Benefits (Change Date December 21, 2022) In accordance with 38 U.S.C. 3681 and 38 CFR 21.4022, a claimant who is eligible for education or training benefits under more than one VA education benefit cannot receive those benefits concurrently. Therefore, the claimant must elect which benefit he or she will receive for the period or periods during which education or training is to be pursued. Typically, this election is required when a claimant who is eligible for Chapter 33 is also eligible and found entitled to Chapter 31. The use of Chapter 31 contract funds for initial evaluation is prohibited if the claimant is in receipt of another VA benefit. Prior to plan development, if the claimant is currently using or has used another VA education benefit, the VRC must notify the Regional Processing Office (RPO) of jurisdiction via email of the effective date of the claimant's election of Chapter 31. An email must be sent to the RPO at Ch31.VAVBABUF@va.gov for the Buffalo RPO or EDU.VBAMUS@va.gov for the Muskogee RPO. The RPO of jurisdiction is associated with the primary address of the facility where the claimant last used his or her VA education benefits. Please see www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/regional_processing.asp for a list of states assigned to each RPO. The VRC must complete the following steps in the process of notifying the RPO: The email must contain the claimant's name, VA File Number, effective date of election to Chapter 31, and the VRC's contact information. If the claimant is being evaluated for a retroactive induction, the email should also specify this. The VRC must verify that the RPO will no longer process additional VA education benefit awards after the end of the current or most recent term. For Chapter 33 specifically, VRCs may also check LTS to determine if there is a scheduled payment for the next term. Generally speaking, Chapter 33 payments are processed 14 calendar days prior to the start of a term. If there is a Chapter 33 enrollment certified in LTS for a future semester and the scheduled payment is 15 or more days in advance, it may be possible for EDU to stop payment and for the claimant to use Chapter 31 benefits instead. However, if the term starts in 14 or fewer days then it is too late for EDU to stop payment and the claimant must wait to use Chapter 31 benefits until the following term. If the VRC does not receive a response from the RPO regarding the claimant's election of Chapter 31 within one-week, the VRC must send a follow-up email to the RPO confirming receipt of the notification. A response from the RPO must be received before VR&E can authorize any services under Chapter 31. The VRC must also notify the School Certifying Official (SCO) of the claimant's election of Chapter 31 benefits to ensure that the correct benefit is certified by the facility.

The Veterans Employment Through Technology Education Courses is commonly referred to as VET TEC. A claimant may enroll in a VET TEC-only program of education or training while participating in a Chapter 31 program; however, the VET TEC program must not be included in an IWRP because it is not an approved Chapter 30, Chapter 31 or Chapter 33 course of education. That means that any VET TEC-only course that is approved for the VET TEC program must not be included in the intermediate objective of a claimant's plan. Hence, payment for subsistence allowance, tuition, fees, books, supplies, or equipment for a VET TEC -only course must not be authorized under Chapter 31. Below are scenarios regarding the VET TEC program: 1. The claimant, who is attending a VEC TEC program when he or she has been determined entitled to Chapter 31, may continue to attend that VET TEC program. However, the claimant's rehabilitation plan must only include courses approved under Chapter 30, 31, or 33. 2. The claimant, who is participating in the Chapter 31 program and elects to apply for a VET TEC program may attend both programs at the same time. However, the claimant's rehabilitation plan must not include the VET TEC program. Note: VET TEC only facilities are identified in WEAMS by the facility code that contains the letter “V”. VET TEC-only approved programs cannot be authorized for training under the Chapter 31 program. e. Vocational Rehabilitation Panel (Change Date August 15, 2013) The Vocational Rehabilitation Panel (VRP) plays a vital role in the development of some rehabilitation plans by providing expert opinions and guidance on complex issues.

The VRC must also inform the claimant of the VRP's recommendations and integrate recommendations into the rehabilitation plan, as applicable. Refer to M28C.II.A.4 for detailed information the VRP. The VA Medical Center (VAMC) consultant will advise the VR&E Officer when other medical specialists are needed as a part of the VRP meeting. Once the case manager and the claimant have discussed the findings and recommendations made by the VRP, the case manager may integrate those recommendations into the rehabilitation plan as appropriate. However, a VRC may choose not to accept the Panel's recommendation(s) if he or she deems the exclusion appropriate. The VRC must document and clearly explain the reason for excluding the Panel's recommendation in an electronic case note in the claimant's VR&E record.

M28C.IV.C.2 Rehabilitation Plan Development and Redevelopment,2.07  Redeveloping the Rehabilitation Plan,"(Change Date November 7, 2013) A rehabilitation plan is a contract between the VA and the Chapter 31 program participant. Thus, the plan must be signed by the VRC and the claimant. Either the claimant or the VRC can request a change to the rehabilitation plan at any time, in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 3107(b). A change to the rehabilitation program goal requires a reevaluation of the claimant's rehabilitation program. This is necessary if the change is major and requires the redevelopment of the primary intermediate objective. However, if the change is necessary to meet the existing rehabilitation program goal such as changing or adding a plan objective, then a reevaluation of the program is not necessary. The VRC must work closely with the claimant to incorporate any change and the claimant must agree with the change to his or her plan. a. Obtaining the Claimant's Cooperation (Change Date November 7, 2013) Successful development and implementation of the rehabilitation plan requires the full and effective participation by the claimant and the rehabilitation professionals assigned to assist the claimant, in accordance with 38 CFR 21.362. The claimant must be informed of all available services and the necessity of full participation. Using rehabilitation counseling skills, the VRC will help the claimant develop an awareness of his or her progress toward the rehabilitation goal. The VRC will assist the claimant to develop coping skills and needed adjustments to accomplish rehabilitation. b. Interaction with the Claimant (Change Date November 7, 2013) The establishment of rapport between the claimant and the VRC is a critical element in the success of any rehabilitation program. The case manager may use the resources of the VRP whenever a multidisciplinary approach would assist in reaching a decision concerning the claimant's rehabilitation program. Refer to M28C.II.A.4 for information on the VRP. c. Major Change in the Plan (Change Date April 26, 2023) A change in a claimant's rehabilitation program goal is considered a major change in the plan. This requires reevaluation of the claimant's rehabilitation program, which is necessary to change the claimant's rehabilitation program goal. In accordance with 38 CFR 21.94, a request to change the program goal can only be made under one of the following conditions: 1. Achievement of the current goal is no longer reasonably feasible and the claimant fully participates in and concurs with the change. 2. The claimant's circumstances have changed or new information has been developed, which makes rehabilitation more likely if a different long-range goal is established and the claimant fully participates in and concurs with the change. A reevaluation for a major change in the plan must assess if the change in the vocational goal meets one of the required conditions specified above. The assessment must examine the circumstances that warrant the change and the claimant's ability to achieve the new program goal. The narrative for the reevaluation must be documented on a new VAF 28-1902n, Counseling Record - Narrative Report (Supplemental Sheet). The justification for the new rehabilitation goal must be included and clearly explained in section 1 of this form. This change requires the signature of the claimant and the VRC on the revised plan.

Either the claimant or the VRC can request a change to the rehabilitation plan at any time, in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 3107(b). A change to the rehabilitation program goal requires a reevaluation of the claimant's rehabilitation program. This is necessary if the change is major and requires the redevelopment of the primary intermediate objective. However, if the change is necessary to meet the existing rehabilitation program goal such as changing or adding a plan objective, then a reevaluation of the program is not necessary. The VRC must work closely with the claimant to incorporate any change and the claimant must agree with the change to his or her plan. a. Obtaining the Claimant's Cooperation (Change Date November 7, 2013) Successful development and implementation of the rehabilitation plan requires the full and effective participation by the claimant and the rehabilitation professionals assigned to assist the claimant, in accordance with 38 CFR 21.362. The claimant must be informed of all available services and the necessity of full participation. Using rehabilitation counseling skills, the VRC will help the claimant develop an awareness of his or her progress toward the rehabilitation goal. The VRC will assist the claimant to develop coping skills and needed adjustments to accomplish rehabilitation. b. Interaction with the Claimant (Change Date November 7, 2013) The establishment of rapport between the claimant and the VRC is a critical element in the success of any rehabilitation program. The case manager may use the resources of the VRP whenever a multidisciplinary approach would assist in reaching a decision concerning the claimant's rehabilitation program. Refer to M28C.II.A.4 for information on the VRP. c. Major Change in the Plan (Change Date April 26, 2023) A change in a claimant's rehabilitation program goal is considered a major change in the plan. This requires reevaluation of the claimant's rehabilitation program, which is necessary to change the claimant's rehabilitation program goal. In accordance with 38 CFR 21.94, a request to change the program goal can only be made under one of the following conditions: 1. Achievement of the current goal is no longer reasonably feasible and the claimant fully participates in and concurs with the change. 2. The claimant's circumstances have changed or new information has been developed, which makes rehabilitation more likely if a different long-range goal is established and the claimant fully participates in and concurs with the change. A reevaluation for a major change in the plan must assess if the change in the vocational goal meets one of the required conditions specified above. The assessment must examine the circumstances that warrant the change and the claimant's ability to achieve the new program goal. The narrative for the reevaluation must be documented on a new VAF 28-1902n, Counseling Record - Narrative Report (Supplemental Sheet). The justification for the new rehabilitation goal must be included and clearly explained in section 1 of this form. This change requires the signature of the claimant and the VRC on the revised plan. The claimant must be provided a copy of the signed plan and a copy must be uploaded into VBMS. The claimant must not change his or her rehabilitation program goal without","1.

Minor Change in the Plan (Change Date April 26, 2023) A change in the intermediate objectives or services in the plan such as a change in training facility, period of services, anticipated completion date, or adding a new objective in the plan, are considered minor changes. The change must be necessary to carry out the claimant's stated long-range goal. The VRC must work closely with the claimant to incorporate the change(s), to his or her plan. The claimant's signature is not required on the revised plan. However, the claimant must agree with the minor change(s) to the plan via email, or the electronic Virtual Assistant (e-VA), which must be documented in the claimant's electronic record.

M28C.IV.C.2 Rehabilitation Plan Development and Redevelopment,2.08  Determining Program Participation Rates,"(Change Date August 15, 2013) 38 CFR 21.310 provides detailed information on determining the rate of pursuit in a rehabilitation program and how to calculate rates for different types of programs. The rate of pursuit must be considered in rehabilitation planning due to its impact on the duration of services and other factors. a. Participation Rates (Change Date October 1, 2020) Participation in a rehabilitation plan should be full time, if possible. However, the goal of full-time participation may not be possible based on the claimant's circumstances. Pursuit at less than full-time may be approved after careful consideration of all relevant factors, including, but not limited to the following: Effects of disability(ies) Family responsibilities Economic circumstances Determination of Reduced Work Tolerance (RWT) Claimant's employment status Participation at less than half-time may be approved on a temporary basis if it is specifically identified in the plan and/or a determination of RWT has been made. The VRC must determine whether the rate of pursuit can be increased to at least half-time upon the completion of the term. In accordance with 38 CFR 21.260, subsistence allowance is not payable when pursuing a plan at less than half-time unless a determination of RWT has been made or unless one-quarter time is allowable for the claimant under an IEEP or IILP. The rehabilitation plan may be developed to enable the claimant to pursue training on a part-time basis if the claimant is working, or intends to work, on a full-time basis. The VRC must determine the rate of pursuit based on the following factors: Employment status (e.g. shift work and its' potential impact on the claimant's ability to participate in the plan.) Financial needs Remaining entitlement and eligibility termination date Anticipated program completion date VA will consider that a claimant with RWT is pursuing a rehabilitation program full-time when the amount of time the claimant is devoting to his or her program is as great as the effects of his or her disability (service and non-service-connected) will permit. This information must be considered when evaluating a claimant's work tolerance and must be communicated to the claimant to help him or her establish an appropriate schedule of activity. Refer M28C.V.B.7 for guidance on calculating entitlement use for less than half-time participation. Refer to M28C.V.A.2 for detailed information on a non-traditional rehabilitation program rate of pursuit. b. Reduced Work Tolerance (Change Date July 16, 2021) RWT occurs when a claimant's functional limitations, as a result of disability(ies), impacts his or her ability to participate in a rehabilitation plan on a full-time basis, in accordance with 38 CFR 21.312. Note: When requesting information from a non-VA healthcare provider, VAF-21-4142, Authorization and Consent to Release Information to the Department of Veterans Affairs must be provided to the healthcare provider. 1. Referral for Reduced Work Tolerance Determination (Change Date July 16, 2021) In accordance with 38 CFR 21.312, the VRC must make a referral to a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner who will make the initial determination, as well as any later redeterminations of work tolerance, using VAF 28-8861, Request for Medical Services-Chapter 31.

This communication should be done in-person or via telephone. The VRC must convey the following information to the claimant: The amount of time the claimant will be expected to participate per week to be considered full-time, as indicated by the claimant's physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. This amount of time includes the time the VRC and claimant estimate it will take for travel to and from the training facility, as well as the time the claimant will spend in preparation for, or practice of, training. An explanation regarding the completion of the program within the claimant's remaining entitlement or the required approval of an extension of entitlement. An explanation that the subsistence allowance is payable at the full-time rate if the claimant participates at the rate identified by a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. Participation at a lower rate requires a redetermination of reduced work tolerance by a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. For example, the physician determines the claimant can participate in six credit hours per semester, which includes the amount of time to travel, prepare and practice for training. If the claimant registers for six credit hours, then subsistence allowance is payable at the full-time rate. However, if the claimant pursues any rate less than six credit hours, subsistence allowance is not payable, and a redetermination of reduced work tolerance must be completed.

M28C.IV.C.3 Extended Evaluation Plan,3.01  Purpose,"(Change Date August 15, 2013) When a claimant is found entitled to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program, the Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) must determine the current feasibility of the claimant achieving a vocational goal. In instances where it is not immediately clear if the achievement of a vocational goal is currently reasonably feasible, VR&E provides a period of extended evaluation. In accordance with title 38 CFR 21.57, the purpose of an extended evaluation is to determine whether it is currently reasonably feasible for a claimant with a serious employment handicap (SEH) to achieve a vocational goal. The VRC must make the determination that a period of extended evaluation is necessary when feasibility to achieve a vocational goal cannot readily be determined based on the information obtained in the initial evaluation. The VRC must document the determination on VAF 28-1902f, Feasibility Determination-Narrative Report. A VRC finding that the achievement of a vocational goal is not currently reasonably feasible, without a period of extended evaluation, requires compelling evidence which establishes infeasibility beyond any reasonable doubt. a. Duration (Change Date August 15, 2013) In accordance with title 38 U.S.C 3105 and 38 CFR 21.74, extended evaluations must be at least two weeks long, but may not exceed 12 months, unless a longer period is necessary to determine whether achievement of a vocational goal is currently reasonably feasible. The VRC can approve the initial 12-month extended evaluation period, but VR&E Officer or designee approval is required for any extension beyond the initial 12-month period. Up to two additional six-month periods (not to exceed 24 months) of extended evaluation may be approved if there is reasonable certainty that the feasibility of achieving a vocational goal can be determined during this period. Any request for an extension beyond the basic period of 12 months must be justified by a discussion of the claimant's circumstances and the issues related to the feasibility of achieving a vocational goal. This justification should be documented in memo format with VR&E Officer or designee concurrence and must be placed in the claimant's VR&E record. Claimants who served during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), and/or Operation New Dawn (OND) can be provided with an initial extended evaluation plan of 18 months if the severity of the claimant's disabilities warrants additional time to make the determination of feasibility. VR&E Officer or designee concurrence is required; concurrence should be documented in memo format and must be placed in the claimant's VR&E record. These types of plans for OEF/OIF/OND claimants require that the following information be documented on a memo: Claimant's Name and Social Security Number (SSN) Station Number Case Manager Number Date the Individualized Extended Evaluation Plan (IEEP) is signed Number of months of planned service under the IEEP All independent living (IL) services as a part of the IEEP Was the individual on active duty when the IEEP was signed?

M28C.IV.C.4 Rehabilitation Plans to Employability,4.02  Rehabilitation to Employability Plans,"The tracks or services to employment are defined as follows: a. Employment Through Long-Term Services (Change Date August 15, 2013) A plan for employment through long-term services provides a claimant an extended period of training and rehabilitation services to ensure that the claimant acquires the skills necessary to obtain and maintain suitable employment. This track is provided to a claimant who may need extensive training or education and necessary rehabilitation services to overcome his or her impairment of employability. Services may include, but are not limited to, remedial or refresher courses; specialized training; post-secondary education; on-the-job training (OJT); non-paid work experience (NPWE); apprenticeships; and other necessary rehabilitation services. b. Rapid Access to Employment Services (Change Date August 15, 2013) A plan for rapid access to employment services provides a claimant services to enhance already acquired skills necessary for him or her to obtain and maintain employment without delay. This plan of services is provided to claimants who express a desire to obtain employment as soon as possible and may already possess the necessary skills to qualify for competitive employment in a suitable career. Services to improve the claimant's rehabilitation potential may include short-term or refresher training, such as interview skills training; job-seeking techniques; resume development; assistance with translating military work experience into civilian work experience; and other necessary rehabilitation services. c. Re-employment (Change Date August 15, 2013) A plan for reemployment services provides a claimant with necessary skills to return to the occupation he or she had held prior to entering active military service. This track is provided to a claimant who may need some short-term or refresher training and rehabilitation services to enhance his or her competency to return to his or her previous employment. If the previous employment is no longer suitable, the claimant must be evaluated to determine if an alternative suitable vocational goal with the same employer is an option. If the claimant can no longer return to his or her previous employer, the VRC should explore the other tracks for employment. d. Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan with a Deferred Vocational Goal (Change Date March 12, 2021) The development of an Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP) with a Deferred Vocational Goal provides a plan of services that will allow provision of training to a claimant, for whom a suitable vocational goal cannot be readily identified, while the claimant is completing the vocational exploration and planning process to identify a suitable vocational goal. Basically, this process allows a claimant's case to “move” from Evaluation and Planning (EP) status to Rehabilitation To the point of Employability (RTE) status without having an identified vocational goal. Vocational exploration and planning activities are conducted in RTE status while the claimant is simultaneously attending training. 1.

M28C.IV.C.4 Rehabilitation Plans to Employability,4.04  Reemployment Rights Information,"(Change Date August 15, 2013) Services provided in the re-employment plan are focused on returning the claimant to the position he or she held prior to active duty. The VRC must complete an occupational analysis to ensure that the claimant's previous employment is suitable, with or without accommodations, and the claimant has the functional capacity to return to his or her former position. The VRC must have sufficient knowledge of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) to assist a claimant to return to his or her previous occupation. Refer to USERRA for detailed information and File a Claim for information on applying for USERRA. USERRA protects civilian job rights and benefits for Veterans and members of the active and Reserve components of the U.S. armed forces. USERRA states that returning Service members must be promptly re-employed in the same position that they would have attained had they not been absent for military service, with the same seniority, status and pay, as well as other rights and benefits determined by seniority. USERRA establishes the cumulative length of time that an individual may be absent from work for military duty and retain reemployment rights to five years (the previous law provided four years of active duty, plus an additional year if it was for the convenience of the Government). There are important exceptions to the five-year limit, including initial enlistments lasting more than five years, periodic National Guard and Reserve training duty, and involuntary active duty extensions and recalls, especially during a time of national emergency. USERRA clearly establishes that reemployment protection does not depend on the timing, frequency, duration, or nature of an individual's service if the basic eligibility criteria are met. USERRA provides protection for claimants with disabilities, requiring employers to make reasonable efforts to accommodate the disability. Service members convalescing from injuries received during service or training may have up to two years from the date of completion of service to return to their jobs or apply for reemployment. The period for an individual to apply for re-employment or report back to work after military service is based on time spent on military duty. For service of less than 31 days, the Service member must return at the beginning of the next regularly scheduled work period on the first full day after release from service, considering safe travel home plus an eight-hour rest period. For service of more than 30 days but less than 181 days, the Service member must submit an application for reemployment within 14 days of release from service. For service of more than 180 days, an application for reemployment must be submitted within 90 days of release from service. USERRA also requires that Service members provide advance written or verbal notice to their employers for all military duty unless giving notice is impossible, unreasonable, or precluded by military necessity. An employee should provide notice as far in advance as is reasonable under the circumstances. Additionally, Service members are able (but are not required) to use accrued vacation or annual leave while performing military duty. If a Veteran or Service member believes his or her re-employment rights are being violated, the VRC must coordinate services by referring him or her to the Department of Labor (DOL) Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS), or the Department",552,"M28C.IV.C.4 Rehabilitation Plans to Employability

Refer to USERRA for detailed information and File a Claim for information on applying for USERRA. USERRA protects civilian job rights and benefits for Veterans and members of the active and Reserve components of the U.S. armed forces. USERRA states that returning Service members must be promptly re-employed in the same position that they would have attained had they not been absent for military service, with the same seniority, status and pay, as well as other rights and benefits determined by seniority. USERRA establishes the cumulative length of time that an individual may be absent from work for military duty and retain reemployment rights to five years (the previous law provided four years of active duty, plus an additional year if it was for the convenience of the Government). There are important exceptions to the five-year limit, including initial enlistments lasting more than five years, periodic National Guard and Reserve training duty, and involuntary active duty extensions and recalls, especially during a time of national emergency. USERRA clearly establishes that reemployment protection does not depend on the timing, frequency, duration, or nature of an individual's service if the basic eligibility criteria are met. USERRA provides protection for claimants with disabilities, requiring employers to make reasonable efforts to accommodate the disability. Service members convalescing from injuries received during service or training may have up to two years from the date of completion of service to return to their jobs or apply for reemployment. The period for an individual to apply for re-employment or report back to work after military service is based on time spent on military duty. For service of less than 31 days, the Service member must return at the beginning of the next regularly scheduled work period on the first full day after release from service, considering safe travel home plus an eight-hour rest period. For service of more than 30 days but less than 181 days, the Service member must submit an application for reemployment within 14 days of release from service. For service of more than 180 days, an application for reemployment must be submitted within 90 days of release from service. USERRA also requires that Service members provide advance written or verbal notice to their employers for all military duty unless giving notice is impossible, unreasonable, or precluded by military necessity. An employee should provide notice as far in advance as is reasonable under the circumstances. Additionally, Service members are able (but are not required) to use accrued vacation or annual leave while performing military duty. If a Veteran or Service member believes his or her re-employment rights are being violated, the VRC must coordinate services by referring him or her to the Department of Labor (DOL) Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS), or the Department","1.

Suitability of Selected Vocational Goal (Change Date October 1, 2020) For a claimant interested in self-employment, the VRC must gather information to determine what type of business he or she would like to start and whether the stated goal is consistent with the claimant's interests, aptitudes, and abilities. The VRC must determine, during the initial evaluation, if the claimant has an existing business. If the claimant has an existing business that is suitable and no accommodations are needed, the VRC must pursue discontinuance since the claimant is suitably employed. b. Existing Business (Change Date October 1, 2020) When a claimant expresses an interest in self-employment, the VRC must assess whether the claimant has an existing business by verifying that both of the following factors apply: The claimant has been self-employed for one year or more (see note below). The business is operational and economically viable as evidenced by tax returns or financial statements that verify generated income. Note: In general, the VRC may accept the claimant's statement whether he or she has been self-employed for a year or more. (This does not apply to evidence validating the business is operational and economically viable.) The only time VA will not accept a claimant's statement concerning being self-employed for a year or more is when the claimant's statement raises a question of validity, the statement conflicts with other evidence in the record, or there is a reasonable indication of fraud or misrepresentation. In these instances, VR&E staff should request income data to verify if the claimant owns an existing business. The VRC must conduct a job analysis on-site at the existing business to determine if the existing business is suitable, if accommodations are needed to enable the claimant to perform essential job functions, and if the claimant has overcome the effects of any identified impairment(s) to employment. Refer to M28C.VI.A.2 for more information on job analysis. When a claimant who owns an existing business has been determined entitled to VR&E services, the VRC must determine whether it is currently reasonably feasible for the claimant to maintain the business as suitable employment. If the existing business is suitable, but the claimant needs accommodations to perform the essential job functions as identified in a job analysis, the services needed to maintain employment must be outlined in a rehabilitation plan. VR&E cannot provide services solely to expand or update an existing suitable business or make it more profitable. If the existing business is not suitable, the VRC must use the job analysis to identify the factors precluding the existing business from being suitable and what services would be needed to address those factors. The VRC must then determine if the needed services are reasonable. If they are not reasonable, the VRC must determine that it is not possible to make the existing business suitable and assist the claimant in selecting a suitable vocational goal. All determinations related to the existing business process must be clearly documented using VA Form (VAF) 28-1902b, VAF 28-1902n, VAF 28-1902f, or in electronic case notes, as appropriate.

Business is Suitable (a) Entitlement Not Determined (Change Date February 14, 2017) If an entitlement determination has not yet been finalized, and after the job analysis it is determined that the business is suitable and accommodations are not needed to enable the claimant to perform essential job functions, the VRC must pursue discontinuance since the claimant has overcome the effects of the identified impairment to employment and would not be entitled for services, as outlined in M28C.IV.B.1 . (b) Entitlement Determined (Change Date February 14, 2017) If the VRC determines that the claimant owns or has started an existing business after the claimant has already been found entitled and the claimant is requesting assistance with the business, the VRC must determine if the business is suitable by conducting a job analysis to determine if accommodations are needed to enable the claimant to perform essential job functions. If the claimant has been determined entitled and the VRC discovers and verifies that the claimant has an existing business that is suitable and accommodations are not needed to enable the claimant to perform essential job functions, the VRC may pursue discontinuance. Refer to M28C.V.A.6 for information on case closures. If a rehabilitation plan has already been written and approved for the claimant, he or she may continue to receive services outlined in his or her current plan to achieve suitable employment. 2. Business is Not Suitable (Change Date October 1, 2020) If the business is not suitable because accommodations are needed to enable the claimant to perform essential job functions, the VRC must determine entitlement and follow the processes for entitlement, feasibility determination, and vocational exploration as outlined in M28C.IV.A.1 , M28C.IV.B.1 , and M28C.IV.B.2 . After selection of a suitable vocational goal, if it is determined that it is appropriate for the claimant to continue pursuit of the existing business, services may be provided under a combined Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP) / Individualized Employment Assistance Plan (IEAP), as outlined in M28C.IV.C.4, to enable the claimant to perform essential job functions. In accordance with 38 CFR 21.254(a), VR&E may authorize payment for an assistive technology specialist to travel to the claimant's workplace and assess his or her worksite to ensure it is ergonomically correct and meets his or her needs. The case will not be considered as a self-employment case for the purposes of vocational rehabilitation. Services must only include accommodations needed to overcome disability related barriers (i.e., referral to a VA Medical Center for therapy and other medical treatment options). Neither a business plan nor category assignment are required for these cases.

Business is Suitable (a) Entitlement Not Determined (Change Date February 14, 2017) If an entitlement determination has not yet been finalized, and after the job analysis it is determined that the business is suitable and accommodations are not needed to enable the claimant to perform essential job functions, the VRC must pursue discontinuance since the claimant has overcome the effects of the identified impairment to employment and would not be entitled for services, as outlined in M28C.IV.B.1 . (b) Entitlement Determined (Change Date February 14, 2017) If the VRC determines that the claimant owns or has started an existing business after the claimant has already been found entitled and the claimant is requesting assistance with the business, the VRC must determine if the business is suitable by conducting a job analysis to determine if accommodations are needed to enable the claimant to perform essential job functions. If the claimant has been determined entitled and the VRC discovers and verifies that the claimant has an existing business that is suitable and accommodations are not needed to enable the claimant to perform essential job functions, the VRC may pursue discontinuance. Refer to M28C.V.A.6 for information on case closures. If a rehabilitation plan has already been written and approved for the claimant, he or she may continue to receive services outlined in his or her current plan to achieve suitable employment. 2. Business is Not Suitable (Change Date October 1, 2020) If the business is not suitable because accommodations are needed to enable the claimant to perform essential job functions, the VRC must determine entitlement and follow the processes for entitlement, feasibility determination, and vocational exploration as outlined in M28C.IV.A.1 , M28C.IV.B.1 , and M28C.IV.B.2 . After selection of a suitable vocational goal, if it is determined that it is appropriate for the claimant to continue pursuit of the existing business, services may be provided under a combined Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP) / Individualized Employment Assistance Plan (IEAP), as outlined in M28C.IV.C.4, to enable the claimant to perform essential job functions. In accordance with 38 CFR 21.254(a), VR&E may authorize payment for an assistive technology specialist to travel to the claimant's workplace and assess his or her worksite to ensure it is ergonomically correct and meets his or her needs. The case will not be considered as a self-employment case for the purposes of vocational rehabilitation. Services must only include accommodations needed to overcome disability related barriers (i.e., referral to a VA Medical Center for therapy and other medical treatment options). Neither a business plan nor category assignment are required for these cases. Prior to case closure, the claimant must receive follow-up services for a minimum of 60 calendar days and a final site visit is required.

The combined IWRP/IEAP guides a claimant who owns an existing business through a program of employment services designed to maintain suitable employment. Since a plan to maintain an existing business is not considered a self-employment plan, neither VR&E Officer nor Executive Director of VR&E Service approval is required unless the annual cost of the plan is over $25,000. Refer to Appendix BH, Existing Business Process Flow Chart, for an overview of the existing business process. c. Preliminary Evaluation Self-Employment Checklist (Change Date February 14, 2017) As part of the vocational exploration process, the VRC must utilize the Preliminary Evaluation Self-Employment Checklist, Appendix G, to determine if self-employment is appropriate for the claimant. The Preliminary Evaluation Self-Employment Checklist is a guide to assess the claimant's needs, potential, suitability and readiness to start a business. The checklist also identifies and addresses all issues or barriers to the successful pursuit of a self-employment plan. Since self-employment is one of the most demanding tracks to employment, at this point in the evaluation the VRC must obtain a clear understanding of the claimant's motivation, functional abilities, and interests.

Category Assignment (Change Date February 14, 2017) The provision of services for self-employment in the IWRP/IEAP is based on category assignment. The VRC must assign the claimant to a category of service when the self-employment track is elected. The category assignment, along with the justification for the assignment must be clearly documented in the claimant's VR&E electronic record. The category assignment is based on the information obtained from the initial evaluation and the vocational exploration process. The VRC must inform the claimant that the provision of services is based on category assignment and that VR&E must not be considered the sole source in establishing a business. Establishing a business requires the claimant to rely mainly on his or her own resources if supplies or related assistance needs are beyond the scope of services that may be provided by VR&E under Category I or Category II assignment. The claimant may need to secure alternate funding sources if his or her business requires services greater than what VR&E can authorize. When identifying services and costs during plan development, the VRC must determine whether the services and costs are essential or optional. 1. Category I (Change Date February 14, 2017) Claimants designated as Category I must meet all the following conditions: Serious employment handicap (SEH) Most-severe service-connected disabilities (SCD). Employability limitations are so severe that self-employment is the only option to achieve the rehabilitation goal. All other reasonable vocational goals are unsuitable due to the severity of the claimant's SCDs. Individualized Extended Evaluation Plan (IEEP) completed. Both the VR&E Officer and Executive Director of VR&E Service concur with the Category I Assignment. See M28C.IV.C.2 for information on the Category I approval process. For a Category I assignment, a realistic start-up budget must only include items that are necessary to start a business. Given the stringent requirements for a Category I assignment, it is anticipated that only a small number of claimants will qualify for this level of self-employment services. If the claimant does not meet the qualifications for Category I, the VRC will consider Category II assignment. In requesting approval of the Category I designation from the Executive Director of VR&E Service, local VR&E staff must submit the following documentation to the VR&E Service Corporate mailbox (VRE.VBACO@va.gov): Memo, signed by the case manager, VR&E Officer, and Regional Office (RO) Director, justifying the approval of the Category I assignment, which must include the Preliminary Evaluation Self-Employment Checklist findings and must sufficiently address the eligibility criteria of the claimant to meet the Category I requirements, A completed VAF 28-1902w, VR&E Questionnaire, Vocational assessment documentation including, but not limited to evidence of vocational exploration, employment history, labor market trends, extended evaluation results, medical information, etc., and VAF 28-1902b, Counseling Record - Narrative Report, with a clear determination of a SEH and feasibility. VR&E Service will provide a response electronically to the RO Director's mailbox within 20 business days to ensure a timely provision of services. 2.

All policy and procedural guidance on the development and administration of an IEEP, as provided in M28C.IV.C.2 and M28C.IV.C.3 apply. The IEEP must be completed before the category assignment. The IEEP must address the claimant's functional limitations and include the following services: The information obtained in the IEEP must be included in the memo to the Executive Director of VR&E Service for Category I approval request. c. Initial Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan Development (Change Date February 14, 2017) The Initial Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP) may be developed when the determination of a suitable vocational goal is made. The rehabilitation plan may be developed as a combined IWRP/IEAP. For Category I cases, this will occur after the IEEP is completed and approval for the Category I assignment is received from the Executive Director of VR&E Service. For Category II cases, this will occur after the category assignment. M28C.IV.C.2 outlines the required elements of all rehabilitation plans. In addition to these required elements, the self-employment IWRP has unique additional requirements and must contain the following intermediate objectives: A copy of Appendix H, Feasibility Study of the Business Concept Checklist, must be given to the claimant as a guide in the process. The VRC must instruct the claimant to address each of the 12 items listed in Appendix H in the order listed on the form and return to the VRC. In providing the information for the feasibility study, the claimant is laying the groundwork for the business plan and gaining information regarding the challenges and risks that he or she will encounter in the pursuit of self-employment. The claimant must be referred to a business consultant to assist with the feasibility study and may also need to talk to business owners or complete additional research to complete the feasibility study. The study must substantially justify the existence of a market for the goods or services that will be produced and/or sold by the small business and support the financial solvency, or ability to pay debts, of the claimant. Note: This IWRP is likely to be amended following completion of the feasibility study and review by the self-employment plan as outlined below in this chapter. d. Feasibility Study 1.

The business plan must be extremely thorough, thought-provoking, and customized for the proposed business. The completed business plan must “tell the story” of the business to a potential lender; it should serve as a stand-alone document in that all business issues are addressed. Note: Most of the funding for small businesses comes from either investors or lenders who will closely scrutinize the financial section of the business plan. Once the claimant submits a business plan, the VRC must conduct an analysis to ensure that the business plan clearly addresses the feasibility of the business and identifies the rehabilitation services needed. To assist with the analysis of the business plan, a VRC must consult with a variety of organizations and entities, including, but not limited to, the business consultant who assisted the claimant with the development of the business plan. Organizations and entities to consult with vary based on the type of business the claimant seeks to pursue; the case manager must use professional judgment in selecting who to consult.

Verification is conducted using one of the following: Claimant only Claimant and spouse Claimant and family member Claimant and non-family member Claimant's family member, or a non-family member, when the claimant resides or intends to reside in the property but is not listed on the title. Note: This option is provided for the claimant that does not own housing that can be adapted or rents the home that will be adapted. The claimant must provide documentation from the owner of the home that states he or she agrees to the modification plan and will allow the claimant to reside in the home. In addition, the claimant must provide a personal statement indicating his or her intent to reside in the home on a permanent basis following the completion of the modification. The VRC must inform and ensure that the claimant understands that there is a limit to the amount of money that he or she can receive from VA grant programs. Once this limit has been met, VA grant programs will no longer provide assistance with home modifications if the claimant moves to another residence. Although there is no such limitation on the delivery of services by VR&E, the VRC must still follow the procedure to ensure that the claimant remains in the home on a permanent basis following the modification. The claimant must be confident that this housing arrangement will be permanent prior to the modification to the home. This process is necessary to ensure public funds are allocated in a responsible manner. 2. Good and Marketable Title (Change Date March 31, 2014) A good and marketable title has no clouds or encumbrances attached to it and can be transferred. Definitions: Good and marketable title - a title that a prudent buyer would accept. Cloud on a title - a defect in the title that prevents an owner from providing a good and marketable title. For example, a lien remains on the title after the owner has paid the lien amount. Encumbrance - an interest in the property held by someone other than the owner that affects the title or the use of the property. For example, the Internal Revenue Service has placed a lien on the property for non-payment of taxes. The claimant must provide verification that the title is good and marketable before the VRC can proceed with the development of the home modification plan. If the clamant qualifies for a VA grant program, such as SAH, SHA, TRA, or HISA, a representative from one of those programs will assist with the provision of this information. However, if the claimant solely depends on VR&E for the provision of home modifications as part of an IILP, then the claimant must obtain this information and provide it to the VRC.

Therefore, the rehabilitation plan is developed as either an IWRP or a combined IWRP/IEAP. Similar to the rapid access to employment plan, the only time it is permissible to develop the plan solely as an IEAP is when the individual was a prior claimant of a vocational rehabilitation program and requires only a program of employment services, as outlined in 38 U.S.C. 3117 and described in section 7.02.e below. d.

Overview (Change Date October 1, 2020) In accordance with 38 CFR 21.123, during an On-the-Job Training (OJT), the claimant receives instructions, observes practical demonstrations of the job requirements, and assists in the performance of the job duties. The OJT consists of a period learning an occupations skill set. This program is ideal for eligible claimants who learn easily in a hands-on environment. A peer or supervisor is assigned to the claimant for mentoring and training while the claimant is assuming the responsibilities of the occupation. After placement in an OJT program, the VRC must closely monitor the claimant's progress to ensure that all training goals are being met. Since claimants who participate in OJT programs are employed by the participating employers from the start, employment is expected to continue after the training program has ended. Therefore, the VRC close monitoring of the claimant's progress will ensure that the employer is satisfied with the claimant's progress and performance for job retention at the conclusion of the OJT. The claimant's work production is expected to gradually increase as the claimant gains more independence from formal instruction. b.

If the claimant needs special equipment and is eligible for the equipment under other VA programs, such as medical care and treatment at VA medical centers, then the items must be provided under that program. When the case manager establishes evidence that special equipment may be needed for a claimant to begin, continue in, or complete a rehabilitation program, a referral to the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) should be completed. The case manager should use VAF 28-8861, Request for Medical Services – Chapter 31, or electronic referral to describe the reason(s) he or she believes special equipment is needed as part of the claimant's rehabilitation plan, and to request that VHA conduct an evaluation and provide any necessary services. Refer to M28C.V.A.4 for further guidance on completing VAF 28-8861 or electronic referral. Before the item may be purchased by VR&E, the VHA physician must determine that the claimant both: Needs the special equipment, and Is ineligible for the needed special equipment under other programs and benefits administered by VA. The major types of special equipment that may be authorized by VR&E include the following: a. Equipment for Educational or Vocational Purposes (Change Date November 7, 2013) This category includes items that are ordinarily used by all individuals pursuing training but are modified to make more accessible to an individual who has a disability (e.g. a calculator with speech capability for a claimant who is blind or visually impaired, a computer keyboard adapted for one-hand typing, or voice activation and speech recognition software). b. Sensory Aids and Prostheses (Change Date November 7, 2013) This category includes items that are specifically designed to mitigate or overcome the effects of disability. They range from eyeglasses and hearing aids to closed-circuit TV systems that amplify reading material for claimants with severe visual impairments. c.

M28C.V.A.4 Medical and Dental Treatment and Services,4.02  Dental Services,"a. Outpatient Emergency Dental Care (Change Date November 7, 2013) VHA is responsible for funding all outpatient dental services and treatment and related dental appliances for claimants, provided the treatment is medically necessary, and the claimant is otherwise receiving VA medical care and services. Dental treatment is limited to what is needed to address acute pain or a dental condition, which is determined to be endangering life or health. Examples include treatment for a significant infection, uncontrolled bleeding, or any other dental condition that is determined to be a severe threat to health or endangering life. The goal of this kind of treatment is to eliminate symptoms and remove foci of infection. Dental care under this category is generally limited to a one-time course of palliative treatment or procedures and appropriate pharmacological therapy. Routine dental care such as cleanings and checkups are not covered under this scope of care. b. Class V Focused Dental Care (Change Date March 6, 2020) When a claimant is determined to be eligible for dental care, the dental facility provides the claimant with an evaluation by a dentist who must determine the appropriate scope of care consistent with the patient's designated dental classification. VR&E claimants are eligible for Class V Focused Dental Care, per VHA Directive 1130, Dental Program for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Facilities, and VHA Handbook 1130, Veterans Health Administration Dental Program. VR&E participants may receive outpatient dental treatment to resolve a specific dental condition dependent upon, and consistent with, the claimant's eligibility status. Treatment may include relief of pain, elimination of infection, or improvement of speech or esthetics. A claimant who is actively receiving VR&E services may receive dental treatment to the extent needed to meet any of the following goals: To make possible the claimant's entrance into a VR&E program. To achieve the goals of the claimant's VR&E program. To prevent interruption of a VR&E program. To expedite the return of a claimant to a VR&E program who is in interrupted or leave status. To expedite the return of a claimant to a VR&E program placed in discontinued status because of illness, injury, or dental condition. To secure and adjust to employment during the Job Ready and Employment Assistance period of the VR&E program. To enable the claimant to achieve maximum independence in daily living. Requests for Class V dental care must be sent to the Dental Service by the Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) using the electronic referral system outlined in Section 4.03 of this chapter or on VAF 28-8861, Request for Medical Services. A dental request must be provided for each episode of care requested. Dental care must not be provided beyond the anticipated rehabilitation date as specified on the form or electronic request for medical services. A claimant who refuses to participate in a requested confirmation examination or refuses to accept a treatment plan determined by VA to be satisfactory must have the claimant's dental treatment referral closed. Such failure to participate is considered the same as a refusal of treatment. c.

VR&E staff may not authorize any payment for training, or any other services related to companion animals. Various organizations advocate the use of companion animals as a means of supporting claimants with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other disabling conditions. Such organizations make it clear that a companion animal is not meant to be a service animal and the animal is not certified as such. A sense of companionship and caring may develop between owners and their pets. The relationship is often described as therapeutic, especially for individuals with emotional or mental health disorders. Companion animals may not commonly be allowed in establishments where service dogs are allowed. b. Service Animals (Change Date November 19, 2015) Service animals are guides, commonly dogs, prescribed for a disabled Veteran under 38 CFR 17.148 related to the Veteran being diagnosed as having a visual, hearing, or substantial mobility impairment. The VA has implemented rules for guide, hearing, and mobility dogs into one regulation, 38 CFR 17.148, Service Dogs. VA does not provide service dogs but does provide veterinary health care and other benefits in support of guide dogs and hearing and mobility service dogs to maximize the life and utility of these specialized dogs. The Veteran must apply for the VA Veterinary Health Benefits through VHA. The clinical requirements for a service dog and potential VA benefits are outlined in 38 CFR 17.148. When a VRC determines that a service dog may be needed for a claimant to begin, continue in, or complete a rehabilitation program, a referral to VHA will need to be completed to evaluate the clinical need for a service dog or guide dog. For more information, visit the VA's website on Service and Guide Dogs. VHA has a well-designed program to assess the claimant's need and ability to benefit from a service dog. The VRC should use VAF 28-8861 or an electronic request for medical services in CAPRI to describe the reason or reasons the VRC believes a service dog may be needed as part of the rehabilitation plan under VR&E and request that VHA conduct an evaluation and provide services deemed necessary. A VHA prescribing clinician will review each request and evaluate the claimant's medical need and circumstances for the following: The claimant's ability and means, including through a family member or caregiver, to care for the dog currently and in the future. The claimant's goals that can be accomplished through the use of the dog. The claimant's goals that can be accomplished through other assistive technology or therapy. VHA will inform the claimant of its approval or disapproval of the request for a service dog. Once approved for a service dog, VHA will refer the claimant to accredited service dog organizations, such as Assistance Dogs International (ADI) or International Guide Dog Federation (IGDF). The referral is done to maintain the integrity of the Service Dog program and ensure claimants are receiving the highest level of quality and training standards for their service animal. There is no charge for the dog or the associated training. However, the claimant will be expected to",565,"M28C.V.A.4 Medical and Dental Treatment and Services

VR&E staff may not authorize any payment for training, or any other services related to companion animals. Various organizations advocate the use of companion animals as a means of supporting claimants with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other disabling conditions. Such organizations make it clear that a companion animal is not meant to be a service animal and the animal is not certified as such. A sense of companionship and caring may develop between owners and their pets. The relationship is often described as therapeutic, especially for individuals with emotional or mental health disorders. Companion animals may not commonly be allowed in establishments where service dogs are allowed. b. Service Animals (Change Date November 19, 2015) Service animals are guides, commonly dogs, prescribed for a disabled Veteran under 38 CFR 17.148 related to the Veteran being diagnosed as having a visual, hearing, or substantial mobility impairment. The VA has implemented rules for guide, hearing, and mobility dogs into one regulation, 38 CFR 17.148, Service Dogs. VA does not provide service dogs but does provide veterinary health care and other benefits in support of guide dogs and hearing and mobility service dogs to maximize the life and utility of these specialized dogs. The Veteran must apply for the VA Veterinary Health Benefits through VHA. The clinical requirements for a service dog and potential VA benefits are outlined in 38 CFR 17.148. When a VRC determines that a service dog may be needed for a claimant to begin, continue in, or complete a rehabilitation program, a referral to VHA will need to be completed to evaluate the clinical need for a service dog or guide dog. For more information, visit the VA's website on Service and Guide Dogs. VHA has a well-designed program to assess the claimant's need and ability to benefit from a service dog. The VRC should use VAF 28-8861 or an electronic request for medical services in CAPRI to describe the reason or reasons the VRC believes a service dog may be needed as part of the rehabilitation plan under VR&E and request that VHA conduct an evaluation and provide services deemed necessary. A VHA prescribing clinician will review each request and evaluate the claimant's medical need and circumstances for the following: The claimant's ability and means, including through a family member or caregiver, to care for the dog currently and in the future. The claimant's goals that can be accomplished through the use of the dog. The claimant's goals that can be accomplished through other assistive technology or therapy. VHA will inform the claimant of its approval or disapproval of the request for a service dog. Once approved for a service dog, VHA will refer the claimant to accredited service dog organizations, such as Assistance Dogs International (ADI) or International Guide Dog Federation (IGDF). The referral is done to maintain the integrity of the Service Dog program and ensure claimants are receiving the highest level of quality and training standards for their service animal. There is no charge for the dog or the associated training. However, the claimant will be expected to","1. What is the difference between a service animal and a companion animal?

General Information (Change date November 7, 2013) In accordance with title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) section 21.197, the purpose of Interrupted (INT) status is to recognize that during the course of a claimant's rehabilitation program, circumstances may arise that would require temporary interruption of his or her rehabilitation program. This means suspension of specific rehabilitation services in an active plan. A case may be placed in INT status from Extended Evaluation (EE), Rehabilitation To the point of Employability (RTE), Independent Living (IL), or Job Ready (JR) statuses, as described in section 5.01.h in this chapter. Extensive efforts must be made to contact the claimant prior to placement of the case in INT status. If the claimant stops actively participating in services, the case manager must attempt to reengage the claimant in services, prior to placing the case in INT status. Contact attempts must be documented, which may include any of the following methods: email e-VA letter telephone b. Interruption is not an Adverse Action (Change date November 27, 2019) Placement into INT status is not considered an adverse action as it is an administrative function required prior to certain case status movement, therefore, it is not necessary to inform the claimant of the movement into INT status. For example, a claimant in JR status opts to pause his or her job search for 6 months due to an upcoming surgery and estimated recovery period. he case manager must move the case into INT status to conserve the18 month limitation on employment services. In this instance, there is no need to inform the claimant of the movement into INT status as this is purely an administrative function and is the result of a planned interruption. c. Interruption Prior to a Proposed Adverse Action (Change Date September 24, 2021) Generally, a case must be moved to INT status prior to taking an adverse action. For example, if the case is being placed in INT status based on a proposed adverse action, such as closure for lack of cooperation or participation, the claimant must be informed of the proposed adverse action and provided a due process period of at least 30 days to take the actions outlined in the proposed adverse action letter. In this situation, the proposed adverse action the claimant is being informed of is the proposed discontinuance of his or her case, not the movement into INT status. When a claimant requests closure of his or her case, placement of the case in INT status prior to the discontinuance is not required or wait for 30 days before closing the case. There are a number of proposed adverse action letters available for use, to include Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) letters 48 and 66.

Claimant's Employment is Closely Related to the Planned Goal (Change Date February 12, 2021) When a claimant obtains employment in a different vocational goal than the one identified on his or her rehabilitation plan, the case manager must make a determination that the employment is, or is not, closely related to the vocational goal outlined in the rehabilitation plan. To make this determination, the case manager must examine both the content of training and the level of training required for both occupations. A claimant must be able to use the training he or she has received from VR&E in the current employment before the current employment can be classified as closely related to the original vocational goal.

However, local VR&E staff must document in the VR&E record all efforts to contact the claimant. After these contact attempts are documented and the case manager identifies information on social media verifying that the claimant is still employed, the case manager must include the following information in the documentation about the social media post: Specific social media platform where the information was identified Date and time when the information was viewed Information contained in the post verifying that the claimant continues to be suitably employed If the case manager is not able to initially obtain employment information directly from the claimant or from a reliable third-party, then merely seeing a social media post about his or her employment is not sufficient to rehabilitate the case.

M28C.V.B.1 Fiscal Responsibilities,1.02  Levels of Authority for Program Costs,"(Change Date November 7, 2013) In accordance with 38 CFR 21.430, VR&E must maintain policies and procedures that provide accountability in the authorization and payment of program costs for training and rehabilitation services. As part of a claimant's rehabilitation program planning, the case manager must estimate the annual program costs for services outlined in the claimant's rehabilitation plan. There are three different levels of authority for approval of program costs. Refer to section b below for the approval levels of program costs. Note: Program costs should not restrict the type of services to be provided to any claimant since the services are based on the identified needs and corresponding services outlined in the claimant's rehabilitation plan. a. Program Costs (Change Date January 18, 2023) Program costs include, but are not limited to, tuition, books, fees, supplies, equipment, and special services and assistance. Program charges do not include subsistence allowance and Revolving Fund Loan (RFL). A Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor's (VRC) program costs approval threshold is $50,000 annually. If the program costs exceed the VRC's approval level, the VRC must complete and submit the high program costs memo to the VR&E Officer. If necessary, the VR&E Officer forwards the request to the RO Director for appropriate level of concurrence and if necessary, the RO Director forwards the request to the Executive Director of VR&E Service. The high program costs memo must include the estimated annual program costs for the claimant's entire period of training. For example, if the estimated costs for the first year of a four-year program is $55,000, the VRC may assume that the estimated costs for the following three years will also be in excess of $55,000, and must indicate such on the high program costs memo. If approved, the high program costs memo covers the entire training period indicated in the plan, assuming that there is no change in the claimant's training facility or vocational goal within that period. The rehabilitation plan must not be signed by either the VRC or the claimant until all required approvals are obtained. Refer to M28C.IV.C.2 for additional information on high program costs. Note: The program costs is an estimate only and other factors may impact actual costs during subsequent years, e.g., tuition increases, claimant opts to attend a summer session for one year, etc. The VRC must complete and/or amend the high program costs memo for that year if the program costs increase and exceed the threshold level. In addition, a VRC cannot approve annual program costs exceeding $25,000 for any of the following rehabilitation plans as outlined in 38 CFR 21.430: 1. Self-employment plan as outlined in M28C.IV.C.5 2. Extended Evaluation plan as outlined in M28C.IV.C.3 3. Independent Living plan as outlined in M28C.IV.C.6 b.

The following guidelines are derived from VA policy and regulations: VA pays in arrears directly to the institution all vouchers for the claimant's tuition, required fees, books and supplies. Therefore, VA must not be billed for a particular term or semester until after any drop/add period for that term has ended. The claimant under Chapter 31 or dependent under Chapter 18 should not have his or her registration cancelled for non-payment of these expenses, since VA has obligated payment for that term. VA should be billed only for the actual cost for tuition and fees assessed by the institution for the program of education after the application of: Any waiver of, or reduction in, tuition and fees; and Any fellowship, scholarship, grant-in-aid, assistantship, or similar award, or other federal, state, instructional, or employer-based aid or assistance that is provided directly to the institution and specifically designated for the sole purpose of defraying tuition and fees, with the following exception: Loans and any funds provided under section 401(b) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a), such as Pell grants, should not be used to reduces the amount billed to VA. If the award limits its use to payment of tuition, fees, or any charge that VA normally pays as part of a claimant's rehabilitation program, then VA will pay the portion of the charges remaining after applying the award. In all other cases, VA will pay the full amount of the tuition, fees, or other charges unless a state or other government authority waives the claimant's tuition and fees. In this situation, VA will reduce the payment of charges by the amount of the waiver. If the claimant receives assistance that is not specifically designated for tuition and fees (funds that may be disbursed directly to the claimant) from a federal, state, or private contribution, the VA will not deny or reduce a Chapter 31 payment on behalf of the claimant unless the claimant actually applies such funds to tuition and fee charges. If the claimant chooses to apply such assistance to tuition and fees, the school should then reduce its bill to the VA by an equal amount. Reimbursement of duplicate funding or errors in accounting: All errors in accounting or disbursing funds should be corrected by the school and any funds that are unused by, or recouped from, the claimant or another source should be returned to the appropriate funding source, including VA.

The law also includes a semiannual congressional reporting requirement of any instance in which the VA fails to make the payment within 60 days. To allow time for funds transfer, any invoice approved after day 57 in IPPS will need to include an explanation. The case manager must select one of the following options in IPPS to explain the reason for late payment: System Impediment: This includes any technical difficulties that cause a delayed payment. For example, IPPS was down for a few days, case manager computer issues, or technical difficulties paying a specific invoice within the system for some reason. Routing Issue: This includes situations where the invoice was sent to the wrong contact person. For example, a case manager goes on an extended leave and invoices are not rerouted to another case manager to authorize payment in a timely manner, or a case is transferred between RO's and the invoice is sent to the originating station. Delinquent Approval: This includes all instances where the correct case manager was provided the invoice, but he or she does not process it on time. Unresolved Dispute with Invoice: This would involve situations of disagreements between VR&E and the facility regarding the accuracy of the invoice. For example, VR&E believes that the invoice is incorrect, but the facility insists that it is valid.

M28C.V.B.4 Government Purchase Card,4.02  Micro-Purchases,"(Change Date October 1, 2020) A micro-purchase is an acquisition of supplies or services using simplified acquisition procedures in which the amount of the total purchase does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold set by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The standard micro-purchase threshold for VR&E purchase cards is set by VBA Office of Financial Management (OFM). For VR&E purchase cardholders, the current micro-purchase threshold is $3,500 per transaction. When the cost of supplies exceeds $3,500 but is less than $10,000, the Approving Official (AO) may request a temporary increase in the cardholder's Single Purchase Limit (SPL) after the VR&E Officer's approval of the needed supplies. The following exceptions apply to the standard micro-purchase threshold: Acquisitions of construction are subject to the Wage Rate Requirement, formerly known as, Davis-Bacon Act with a limit of $2,000.  
Acquisitions of services are subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards (SCLS) with a limit of $2,500. The purchase of combined goods and services that exceeds the SCLS threshold of $2,500 must not be made using a purchase card. For example, ABC company is hired to install a new front door for a claimant's home and the estimated cost of the requirement is $2,600 ($1,900 for the door and $600 for the labor).  Since the cost exceeds the SCLS threshold of $2,500, this purchase cannot be made via purchase card.

4.02  Micro-Purchases

(Change Date October 1, 2020) A micro-purchase is an acquisition of supplies or services using simplified acquisition procedures in which the amount of the total purchase does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold set by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The standard micro-purchase threshold for VR&E purchase cards is set by VBA Office of Financial Management (OFM). For VR&E purchase cardholders, the current micro-purchase threshold is $3,500 per transaction. When the cost of supplies exceeds $3,500 but is less than $10,000, the Approving Official (AO) may request a temporary increase in the cardholder's Single Purchase Limit (SPL) after the VR&E Officer's approval of the needed supplies. The following exceptions apply to the standard micro-purchase threshold: Acquisitions of construction are subject to the Wage Rate Requirement, formerly known as, Davis-Bacon Act with a limit of $2,000.  
Acquisitions of services are subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards (SCLS) with a limit of $2,500. The purchase of combined goods and services that exceeds the SCLS threshold of $2,500 must not be made using a purchase card. For example, ABC company is hired to install a new front door for a claimant's home and the estimated cost of the requirement is $2,600 ($1,900 for the door and $600 for the labor).  Since the cost exceeds the SCLS threshold of $2,500, this purchase cannot be made via purchase card. Only a cardholder who has a warrant can make simplified acquisitions over the micro-purchase threshold of $10,000.  A VR&E Officer and his or her designee must consult with their local VBA Acquisition Contracting Officer on issues related to purchases over the micro-purchase threshold.

Prepayment of transportation by common carrier and/or lodging expenses, as applicable, must be completed via the RO's Centrally Billed Account (CBA) travel card that is funded through Readjustment Benefits Account (RB). The CBA travel card is essentially the same as a regular purchase card but is used specifically for travel related expenses. All prepaid travel costs require prior approval from the claimant's case manager and the determination to authorize prepaid travel must be documented in CWINRS Notes. VR&E staff must contact the local SSD for assistance with the purchase of prepaid travel expenses. A memo signed by the case manager authorizing the purchase of transportation and lodging, as applicable, must be submitted to SSD when requesting prepayment of travel expenses using the CBA travel card. The memo must include the following: Claimant's name as shown on the claimant's government-issued identification,
Date of birth, if flights are required,
Travel dates,
Location of training or employment site,
Purpose of trip,
Estimated cost of travel,
Date and description of purchase, and
Any constraints that must be considered when booking. As SSD books flights and hotel and receives confirmation, the information is forwarded to VR&E, who then provides the information to the claimant. Actual costs associated with prepaid travel must be recorded in CWINRS with costing charged to the RB account, Budget Object Code (BOC) 4146. Other reimbursable expenses, such as meals and mileage, that are not charged on the CBA travel card, must be processed using VAF 28-0968 and documented in electronic case notes. VR&E staff must ensure that the claimant traveled and incurred the travel expenses purchased with the CBA card, as documented in electronic case notes.  Documents related to prepaid travel, such as the SSD memo and VAF 28-0968, must be filed in the claimant's VR&E record or uploaded to VBMS. If your RO does not have a CBA travel card, contact TRAVEL.VBACO@va.gov for assistance in obtaining the proper card.  In the rare instances that the CBA card is not available for prepayment of beneficiary travel and the delay will adversely impact the claimant's participation in VR&E, the Government Purchase Card (GPC) may be used to pay for such required travel.

The CBA travel card is essentially the same as a regular purchase card but is used specifically for travel related expenses. All prepaid travel costs require prior approval from the claimant's case manager and the determination to authorize prepaid travel must be documented in CWINRS Notes. VR&E staff must contact the local SSD for assistance with the purchase of prepaid travel expenses. A memo signed by the case manager authorizing the purchase of transportation and lodging, as applicable, must be submitted to SSD when requesting prepayment of travel expenses using the CBA travel card. The memo must include the following: Claimant's name as shown on the claimant's government-issued identification,
Date of birth, if flights are required,
Travel dates,
Location of training or employment site,
Purpose of trip,
Estimated cost of travel,
Date and description of purchase, and
Any constraints that must be considered when booking. As SSD books flights and hotel and receives confirmation, the information is forwarded to VR&E, who then provides the information to the claimant. Actual costs associated with prepaid travel must be recorded in CWINRS with costing charged to the RB account, Budget Object Code (BOC) 4146. Other reimbursable expenses, such as meals and mileage, that are not charged on the CBA travel card, must be processed using VAF 28-0968 and documented in electronic case notes. VR&E staff must ensure that the claimant traveled and incurred the travel expenses purchased with the CBA card, as documented in electronic case notes.  Documents related to prepaid travel, such as the SSD memo and VAF 28-0968, must be filed in the claimant's VR&E record or uploaded to VBMS. If your RO does not have a CBA travel card, contact TRAVEL.VBACO@va.gov for assistance in obtaining the proper card.  In the rare instances that the CBA card is not available for prepayment of beneficiary travel and the delay will adversely impact the claimant's participation in VR&E, the Government Purchase Card (GPC) may be used to pay for such required travel.  Please refer to M28C.V.B.4  for information regarding use of the GPC.   Back to Top of Page","1. What is the Centrally Billed Account (CBA) travel card?

Therefore, the Regional Processing Office (RPO) does not need to be notified. Review Long-Term Solution (LTS) to determine if claimant was receiving kicker payments. If so, the VRC must inform the claimant that Education Service (EDU) will create an overpayment for the retroactive period once the entitlement is moved from Chapter 33 to Chapter 31. Review LTS to determine if the claimant received or is receiving the STEM Scholarship. If so, the VRC must inform the claimant that EDU must create an overpayment for the STEM funds used if the retroactive induction is pursued. The VRC can identify the approximate STEM overpayment that will be created by viewing the most recent STEM award in the “Work Product History” screen in LTS. Once in the award, the VRC should look at the STEM “funds remaining” listed and subtract this amount from $30,000 since $30,000 is the maximum amount that a claimant can receive under STEM. Claimants may receive up to $30,000 or 9 months of benefits, whichever comes first. If the claimant requests the details of the potential STEM debt, to include what portion of STEM was applied to tuition/fees, books/supplies, and housing allowance, the VRC must email the Buffalo RPO at the address mentioned in section 6.04.c of this chapter and request a STEM financial audit. The Buffalo RPO is the only RPO that handles STEM benefits. Note: The enrollment periods under STEM may be included in the retroactive induction if they can be applied to the claimant's vocational goal on his or her rehabilitation plan. Additionally, despite the official policy to create a STEM debt not being revised until September 9, 2022, STEM debts will be created for all retroactive inductions where STEM was received regardless of when the retroactive induction was initiated. The claimant will solely be responsible for this debt if the enrollment periods cannot be included in the retroactive induction. Furthermore, once STEM is terminated this will restore some or all of the 9 months and funds used under STEM, but the two-year STEM delimiting date which was established when STEM payments first began, will not be reset. However, the claimant may reapply for STEM in the future and may have a new STEM COE issued if funds are available. Review Appendix CY with the claimant. Signing Appendix CY includes a statement verifying that the claimant understands that an overpayment for the kicker and STEM funds will be established, if applicable. Appendix CY must be uploaded to the claimant's VR&E record once signed. Note: If the claimant does not want the entitlement moved, the claimant must update Appendix CY to indicate he or she wants to withdraw the request for retroactive induction for a period previously completed under Chapter 33.

The specific situation in which a claimant could have used Chapter 35 and have a retroactive induction approved to bring the previous Chapter 35 enrollment period(s) into Chapter 31 is when a claimant is both a dependent and a Veteran. For example, a claimant used Chapter 35 specialized vocational training since she is the spouse of a Veteran with a 100% SCD rating. However, she also served in the Army and has a SCD rating herself, which makes her eligible to apply for Chapter 31. In this situation, the claimant may have her previously used Chapter 35 enrollment periods approved for a retroactive induction to Chapter 31 if the eligibility criteria in 38 CFR 21.282(c) are met and it is determined that having used Chapter 31 for the previous enrollment periods as opposed to Chapter 35 would be advantageous for the claimant. a. Important Items to be Aware of When Processing a Retroactive Induction Involving Chapters 30, 35, and 1606 (Change Date September 23, 2022) Local VR&E staff must be mindful of the items listed below when processing retroactive inductions involving previous periods under Chapters 30, 35, and 1606. Retroactive inductions involving Chapters 30, 35, and 1606 are processed in the system and do not involve Appendix AH, Retroactive Induction Calculator. Education Service (EDU) will create a debt for the educational allowance received under the other VA education program, which will largely be offset by the retroactive Chapter 31 subsistence allowance award(s) once entered. The key is to have the Chapter 31 subsistence allowance award(s) for the retroactive period(s) be applied to the EDU debt. To accomplish this, the procedures detailed below must be followed and open communication between the VRC, local Support Services Division (SSD), and the respective Regional Processing Office (RPO) must be maintained. Local VR&E staff must contact their assigned VR&E Service Field Liaison for any assistance needed with these procedures. Due to an Office of Financial Management system's limitation that will be addressed in an upcoming system's update, it is currently only possible to process a retroactive induction for a period previously completed under Chapters 30, 35, or 1606 when there is at least one Chapter 31 subsistence allowance award already in the Subsistence Allowance Module (SAM). Therefore, if a claimant has not previously used Chapter 31 and he or she is also being approved for a current or future enrollment period(s) under Chapter 31, the Chapter 31 subsistence allowance award must be entered for the current or future enrollment period(s) before any of the retroactive induction enrollment periods can be processed. If the claimant does not have a previous Chapter 31 award in the system and he or she is not being approved for any current or future enrollment period(s), however, the processing of the retroactive induction cannot occur until the system update is complete. VR&E Service will notify local VR&E staff once the system is updated. Local VR&E staff must refresh the AutoGED for the claimant's record prior to entering any subsistence allowance award(s) associated with the retroactive induction.

Education Service (EDU) will create a debt for the educational allowance received under the other VA education program, which will largely be offset by the retroactive Chapter 31 subsistence allowance award(s) once entered. The key is to have the Chapter 31 subsistence allowance award(s) for the retroactive period(s) be applied to the EDU debt. To accomplish this, the procedures detailed below must be followed and open communication between the VRC, local Support Services Division (SSD), and the respective Regional Processing Office (RPO) must be maintained. Local VR&E staff must contact their assigned VR&E Service Field Liaison for any assistance needed with these procedures. Due to an Office of Financial Management system's limitation that will be addressed in an upcoming system's update, it is currently only possible to process a retroactive induction for a period previously completed under Chapters 30, 35, or 1606 when there is at least one Chapter 31 subsistence allowance award already in the Subsistence Allowance Module (SAM). Therefore, if a claimant has not previously used Chapter 31 and he or she is also being approved for a current or future enrollment period(s) under Chapter 31, the Chapter 31 subsistence allowance award must be entered for the current or future enrollment period(s) before any of the retroactive induction enrollment periods can be processed. If the claimant does not have a previous Chapter 31 award in the system and he or she is not being approved for any current or future enrollment period(s), however, the processing of the retroactive induction cannot occur until the system update is complete. VR&E Service will notify local VR&E staff once the system is updated. Local VR&E staff must refresh the AutoGED for the claimant's record prior to entering any subsistence allowance award(s) associated with the retroactive induction. If this is not done, an error message will be received in CWINRS and the award(s) will not","1.

However, it should be noted that the following appendices, which are separate from those used for retroactive inductions involving Chapter 33, have been developed and must be used to ensure that the specific issues associated with retroactive inductions involving Chapters 30, 35, and 1606 are addressed: Appendix EF, Chapters 30, 31, 35, and 1606 Benefits Comparison, must be used to assist the claimant in understanding the differences between the Chapter 30, 31, 35, and 1606 programs. Appendix EE, Claimant Checklist – Retroactive Induction for a Period Previously Completed Under Chapter 30, 35, and 1606, must be used to allow the claimant to officially request a retroactive induction. Appendix EG, VRC Checklist – Retroactive Induction for a Period Previously Completed Under Chapter 30, 35, and 1606, may be used by VRCs as a resource in completing the retroactive induction process. When exploring the possibility of a retroactive induction with the claimant, the VRC may email the respective RPO, as specified in section 6.04.c of this chapter, and ask for the amount of debt that would be created if the retroactive induction is approved. This will help the claimant make an informed decision about whether to pursue the retroactive induction. The email to the RPO must include the following information: Claimant's name, VA File Number, Effective Date for the proposed retroactive induction, Specify what previously used VA education benefit VR&E would request for the proposed retroactive induction, Previous enrollment periods under the other VA education benefit that would be approved indicated by start and end dates for each period, The VRC's contact information, and A clear and bolded annotation in the email that this is a proposed retroactive induction that has not been approved yet, and therefore, the previous education benefit must not be terminated until further notice.

EDU will take the newly created debt in BDN and change it from collection code status “1” to collection code status “2” non-collectible on the M01 screen with a CORR command to prevent the Debt Management Center (DMC) from collecting the debt. The RPO must inform the VRC via email of the debt information once it is established in BDN, to include a BDN screenshot of the M01 screen which shows the amount of debt, collection code, and the date it was created. In addition to emailing the VRC, the RPO must also email the DMC at DMC_TEEMgmt@va.gov with the debt information and request that the DMC not send debt letters pertaining to this debt. The debt letters are not necessary at this time and could cause confusion to the claimant since the Chapter 31 subsistence allowance payments associated with the retroactive induction will be applied to the debt as stated in a step below. After this occurs, the VRC must: Email the School Certifying Official (SCO) informing the facility of the claimant's approved retroactive induction and switch to Chapter 31. The email must inform the SCO to not terminate any past enrollment certifications from the other EDU program(s) or recertify under Chapter 31 for the retroactive period.

Open Chapter 31 Cases (Change Date September 23, 2022) If retroactive processing was not previously completed and the case is currently in Evaluation and Planning (EP), Rehabilitation To the point of Employability (RTE), Interrupted (INT), or Job Ready (JR) status, the VRC must review the case to determine whether the claimant meets the criteria for a retroactive induction, as outlined in section 6.02.a of this chapter. If the claimant meets the criteria, all procedures in section 6.04 of this chapter must be followed for retroactive inductions involving previous periods under Chapter 33 and the procedures in section 6.05 of this chapter must be followed for retroactive inductions involving previous periods under Chapters 30, 35, and 1606. b.

A claimant may not initiate a new claim or request a closed claim to be reopened solely for the purpose of retroactive induction. VR&E does not have the authority to allow retroactive induction for closed cases; therefore, the only time it is permissible to process a retroactive induction for a closed case, meaning a case in Rehabilitation (REH) or Discontinued (DIS) status is when: There is documented proof that the claimant completed and returned Appendix CY or Appendix EE while he or she was actively participating in a Chapter 31 rehabilitation plan, and VR&E did not process the retroactive induction. Note: The procedures for processing a retroactive induction for cases in a closed status are only for administrative errors. Cases must not be intentionally rehabilitated or discontinued when a retroactive induction has been requested and not yet processed. If the claimant later wants to pursue a retroactive induction after his or case is closed and the criteria above are met, the VRC must schedule an appointment with the claimant. During the appointment, the VRC must determine if the claimant meets the eligibility criteria for retroactive induction detailed in section 6.02.a of this chapter.

A claimant may not initiate a new claim or request a closed claim to be reopened solely for the purpose of retroactive induction. VR&E does not have the authority to allow retroactive induction for closed cases; therefore, the only time it is permissible to process a retroactive induction for a closed case, meaning a case in Rehabilitation (REH) or Discontinued (DIS) status is when: There is documented proof that the claimant completed and returned Appendix CY or Appendix EE while he or she was actively participating in a Chapter 31 rehabilitation plan, and VR&E did not process the retroactive induction. Note: The procedures for processing a retroactive induction for cases in a closed status are only for administrative errors. Cases must not be intentionally rehabilitated or discontinued when a retroactive induction has been requested and not yet processed. If the claimant later wants to pursue a retroactive induction after his or case is closed and the criteria above are met, the VRC must schedule an appointment with the claimant. During the appointment, the VRC must determine if the claimant meets the eligibility criteria for retroactive induction detailed in section 6.02.a of this chapter. In this situation, the claimant does not need to currently meet entitlement criteria to VR&E but must meet all other eligibility criteria for a retroactive induction. If the claimant is eligible for a retroactive induction, the following steps must be taken: Follow all applicable procedures in section 6.04 or section 6.05 of this chapter depending on which VA education benefit was previously used. Reactivate the case, but the case must remain in the REH or DIS status while the retroactive approval is processed. The rehabilitation plan must not be redeveloped. Document all retroactive services that have been approved in an electronic case note. Inform the claimant via VR-64, to include VAF 20-0998. If the claimant is determined not eligible for a retroactive induction, the following steps must be taken: Send VR-58 to include VAF 20-0998. Document reason for the denial in an electronic case note.","1. What is the 48-month rule?

For claimants who previously received a retroactive reimbursement, the following actions must be completed to properly move entitlement from Chapter 33 to Chapter 31. This will allow Chapter 33 entitlement to be returned to the claimant. a. Factors to Consider Prior to Moving Entitlement (Change Date September 24, 2021) The VRC must consider the following when reviewing all cases where a retroactive reimbursement was previously completed: Determine if the claimant is within his or her delimitating date for Chapter 33. If not, there is no need to move the entitlement since the claimant will not be able to use it. If the claimant is determined to only have an Employment Handicap, the total period for which a claimant may receive a program of rehabilitation under CH31 alone may not exceed 48 months. If the claimant received kicker payments, the VRC must reach out to the claimant to determine if he or she wants entitlement moved because an overpayment will be created for the amount of the kicker for the retroactive period. The claimant must provide confirmation in writing (email preferred); Electronic Virtual Assistant (e-VA) correspondence; or a completed VAF 28-10212, Chapter 31 Request for Assistance, regarding the claimant's decision on whether or not to move his or her entitlement and that he or she understands an overpayment will be created for kicker payments, if applicable. This confirmation must be uploaded to the claimant's electronic case file. For closed cases, reactivate the case but do not move the case from the current case status. Entitlement must only be moved for the periods previously completed retroactive reimbursements. Note: If the case is currently in DIS or REH status and the previous retroactive reimbursement was completed for only one-term, the claimant must be contacted to determine if he or she is interested in having the entitlement from the one-term of the retroactive reimbursement moved from Chapter 31 to Chapter 33. All applicable steps listed above and in section 6.04 of this chapter must be followed. However, the case must remain in DIS or REH status and the claimant cannot be evaluated for additional terms of retroactive approval beyond the one-term that was previously approved. If the claimant wishes to be evaluated for additional retroactive terms, he or she must first reapply for VR&E benefits and be determined entitled. b.

Refer to Cost of Living Adjustment and Options to the current Fiscal Year Subsistence Allowance Rates for Chapter 31 Subsistence Allowance Rates, for guidance on determining rate of payment. Note: Some institutions of higher learning offer courses that are not measured in whole credit hours. When entering the number of credit hours in SAM, only whole numbers can be entered. Therefore, any fraction must be dropped from the final number before entering the number in SAM. Example: A training facility reports that a student is enrolled in 13.5 hours for a semester. Therefore, 13 credits would be entered in SAM. Please see section 7.10.e of this chapter for more information on calculating overlapping terms with courses that are not measured in whole credit hours.

The case manager must enter all Enrollment Manager certifications in SAM even if it is less than half time training rate. Refer to M28C.IV.C.2 for further guidance on RWT. SA payments are prorated on the number of days attended each month and payments are made in arrears. Payment is issued for the dates of training.

Graduate Coursework 1. Overview (Change Date August 27, 2021) On August 11, 2020 a new process was implemented for certifying training hours for graduate programs that stated SCOs must provide additional information on the Enrollment Manager for Chapter 31 claimants attending graduate programs. In addition to certifying the number of credit hours the claimant takes, which apply to his or her program, the SCO must also report the number of credit hours considered full time. Therefore, when certifying in Enrollment Manager, SCOs will report the number of credit hours a claimant is taking in a term in the ""Credit Hours"" box, and also the minimum number of hours required for full-time training in the ""Training Time"" box on the certification screen. If the Full-Time training requirement is not listed in the Enrollment Manager, case managers must contact the SCO and request an amended Enrollment Manager with the correct number of hours required. During the August 2021 Office Hours Webinars, SCOs were issued revised guidance in a Procedural Advisory developed by Education Service dated August 13, 2021 (see Appendix DV). The information explains how SCOs should calculate the full-time requirement for standard and non-standard terms for graduate programs when the school has an individually defined full-time modifier (IDM) and when the school does not have an IDM. This means the SCOs will report the number of full-time hours, regardless of whether their school has an IDM or not. This change in procedure will also apply to Chapter 31 programs for terms beginning on or after September 1, 2021 and will result in two changes to the previous process for calculating the rate of pursuit for Chapter 31 claimants attending graduate programs as follows: (a) Since it is now the SCO's responsibility to calculate the defined or adjusted full-time modifier, VRCs will no longer convert the certified credit hours for non-standard terms to equivalent credit hours (ECH). (b) There is no longer a need for SCOs to include ""Graduate non-standard term"" in the VBA Standard Remarks section of the Enrollment Manager. SCOs should follow the same procedures to certify graduate programs for Chapter 31 claimants in the same way as Chapter 33. The procedures are outlined in the Procedural Advisory issued by Education Service dated August 13, 2021 (Appendix DV). 2. Calculating Rate of Pursuit (Change Date August 27, 2021) Upon receipt of the Enrollment Manager, the claimant's rate of pursuit must be calculated as follows: Divide the number of credit hours reported in the Training Time field by the number of hours reported in the Full-time field (TT/FF).

In accordance with 38 CFR 21.260, a claimant in an apprenticeship or OJT program must be paid a monthly subsistence allowance rate. 1. Wage Schedule (Change Date October 1, 2020) The claimant's employer must document the wage schedule to be paid to the claimant while in the program and must specify the journeyman wage for the job. This information must be provided by the employer on a company letterhead and must be signed by the employer. The claimant's wages should gradually increase as he or she completes the apprenticeship and OJT program. If there is a change in either the journeyman or the training wage, the subsistence allowance award should be adjusted accordingly. An example wage schedule is demonstrated as follows: Journeyman salary = $2000/month Duration of apprenticeship or OJT = 12 months Wages for first 4 months = $1200/month Wages for next 4 months = $1500/month Wages for last 4 months = $1800/month Wages at end of program = $2000/month 2. Determining Apprenticeship and On the Job Training Monthly Subsistence Allowance (Change Date December 18, 2020) In accordance with 38 CFR 21.4270, subsistence allowance is paid to claimants participating in the apprenticeship and OJT program at the full-time rate only. A standard full-time workweek is 40 hours unless the employing agency defines full-time as less than 40 hours for all employees in the particular position approved for apprenticeship and OJT. The monthly subsistence rate should be based on an average of the total hours completed for the month. In accordance with 38 U.S.C. 3677, the starting training wage for an OJT program must be at least 50 percent of the journeyman wage. The monthly subsistence allowance rate is determined using the difference in amounts between the journeyman wage and the training wage, not including overtime, to calculate the monthly amount. The monthly amount must not exceed the Chapter 31 Subsistence Allowance rate or the P911SA rate. Employers must complete and submit VAF 28-1905c each month to the case manager for review. The original form should be submitted to VA no later than the 10th day after the end of each month. This form documents the following: Attendance Progress Changes in wage status The subsistence allowance award must be adjusted as the claimant gains proficiency and moves toward journeyman level. Upon receipt of the VAF 1905c, VR&E staff must ensure that subsistence allowance is appropriately entered in SAM. Refer to M28C.V.A.1 for additional procedural guidance on apprenticeship and OJT.

The form should be submitted to VRE staff no later than the 10th day after the end of each month. Since the NPWE monthly subsistence allowance may change based on hours worked, the claimant should be notified they may consider opportunities to make up missed workdays (i.e., sick days or personal days), so that the total number of hours completed by the end of the month is consistent with the desired rate of pay. The case manager must adjust the award accordingly. Subsistence allowance for both NPWE and NPWE combination training must be paid at the institutional rate when total training time is at least half-time. If the employer's standard full-time work schedule is less than 40 hours, the number of hours the employer considers full-time will be used to calculate the training time of the NPWE or NPWE portion of the combination training (full-time, three-quarter time, half-time and one-quarter time). Quarter-time is not payable for sole NPWE training but may be used to calculate subsistence allowance for NPWE combination training. When P911SA has been elected, the zip code of either the NPWE agency or the training facility must be used to ensure that the greater benefit is provided to the claimant.

Example 1: A claimant with no dependents who is attending training at the CH31SA full-time rate ($585.11) and usually receives compensation at the 80% rate ($1,277), totaling $1,862.11, would not be eligible to receive subsistence allowance since the subsistence allowance combined with the temporary 100% rate ($2,393) equals $2,978.11 which is greater than $1,862.11. Therefore, the claimant should receive only the temporary 100% rate and no subsistence allowance. The subsistence allowance award must be terminated the day before the increased disability compensation award. The subsistence allowance award must be restarted following the reinstatement of the prior rating. Example 2: A claimant who is attending training at the full-time P911SA rate ($2,193) and receives compensation at the 80% rate ($1,277) totaling $3,470, would receive a reduced subsistence allowance since the subsistence allowance combined with the temporary 100% rate ($2,393) equals $4586 which is greater than $3470. The subsistence allowance must be reduced to the difference between the temporary 100% rate ($2,393) and the total amount of subsistence allowance and regular compensation ($3,470), which equals $1,077. This means that the claimant's subsistence allowance will be reduced from $2,193 to $1,077 while hospitalized and receiving the temporary 100% rate. The subsistence allowance award must be reduced the day before the increased disability compensation award. The subsistence allowance award must be adjusted following the reinstatement of the prior rating. c.

The case manager finds, and the claimant agrees, that it is to his/her advantage to pay the cost of room and board. Note: The claimant is only eligible for subsistence allowance payable for his or her dependents when VA pays the cost of room and board. d. Extended Evaluation and Independent Living Program (Change Date November 7, 2013) In accordance with 38 CFR 21.79, a claimant in a program of extended evaluation or an Independent Living (IL) program may be paid subsistence allowance for full, three-quarter, half-time, or quarter-time participation at the rate specified for institutional training.

If a claimant does not complete training attendance and does not receive a grade or a non-punitive grade towards his or her degree, VA must reduce his or her subsistence allowance effective the first day of the term. The case manager must amend the subsistence allowance award to create an overpayment if VA has paid for a course assigned a non-punitive grade, unless one of the following exceptions applies: The student can establish that the failure to complete the course was due to mitigating circumstances. The student was ordered to active duty. The course withdrawal occurred during the drop/add period. The award must be adjusted within 10 business days of receipt of Enrollment Manager. Case managers do not need to amend a subsistence allowance award for a change in training hours that does not change the rate of pursuit. Example: if the Veteran reduces training from 18 to 15 semester hours, no action should be taken on the award since the reduced training of 15 semester hours is still considered full-time training. The case manager must document the reduction and the reason for the reduction in an electronic case note.

Mitigating Circumstances (Change Date October 1, 2020) Mitigating circumstances are conditions beyond the claimant's control, which prevent continuous pursuit of his or her training program. When a claimant reduces his or her training rate or withdraws completely from training, the case manager must assist the claimant to resolve difficulties and avoid overpayments or program interruption. The case manager must determine whether mitigating circumstances exist when a claimant reduces or withdraws completely from training. If mitigating circumstances exist, the subsistence allowance award must be reduced or stopped as follows: for complete withdrawal, stop the award on the last date of attendance. for partial withdrawal, reduce the award on the last day of the month or the last day of the term, whichever is earlier. If mitigating circumstances do not exist, the subsistence allowance payment must be reduced or stopped on the first day of the term. 1.

Debt Management (Change Date April 20, 2018) A reduction or withdrawal from training may result in changes to the claimant's subsistence allowance payment. If subsistence allowance has been paid and an amendment is subsequently made for the certified enrollment period, a debt will be created for the claimant. Note: The claimant is responsible for informing the SCO of the reduction or withdrawal to ensure the certification is correct and the updated information is sent the VA. The Debt Management Center (DMC) is responsible for managing debts created on Chapter 31 subsistence allowance. Once the debt is established, DMC will notify the claimant using VP-001, VRE Notification -Overpayment, explaining the process for requesting a waiver. The letter also informs the claimant of the amount of overpayment and that DMC will contact him or her regarding a repayment plan. VR&E staff must be aware of the process for requesting a waiver or consideration for a compromise offer from the appropriate Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC). For more information visit the DMC website. b. Procedures for Correcting Overpayments due to Administrative Errors (Change Date November 3, 2013) An administrative error is an error solely created by a VA employee when processing VA benefits that results in an erroneous payment or award. A debt must not be created. A claimant must not be held financially responsible for overpayment that resulted solely from an administrative error. In accordance with 38 U.S.C. 5112(b)(10) and 38 CFR 21.7135(v)(2), when an administrative error is the sole cause of an erroneous award, VA must reduce or terminate the award effective the date of last payment to avoid an overpayment. Corrective action should be taken as soon as an overpayment caused by administrative error is identified. VR&E staff must not attempt to correct the award back to the beginning of the award period. The award should be corrected effective the day after the ""Date Last Paid"" to avoid creation of debt and further erroneous payments. Example: A claimant was authorized the P911SA rate for the period of 8/21/2020 to 12/10/2020 but was only eligible to receive the Ch31SA rate. The VRC discovers the error on 9/10/2020, since the claimant was already paid for the month of August, no overpayment should be created for the period paid. However, the award should be adjusted on 9/1/2020 to the correct rate. The VRC must notify the claimant and complete an administrative error memo to the VR&E Officer. Below are some additional common errors: For an award corrected in early June in which the payment for the month of May has been made but the June payment has not been processed, the begin date of the corrected award is June 1st For an award corrected in late June in which the payment for June had already been processed, the begin date of the corrected award is July 1st.

If a decision to grant an apportionment is made, VR&E staff must determine the amount awarded from an equitable assessment of any hardship or demonstrated need on the part of the claimant and the dependent(s). The amount apportioned should be consistent with the total number of dependents involved. In accordance with 38 CFR 3.451, an apportionment of more than fifty percent of the claimant's subsistence allowance would constitute undue hardship on him or her while apportionment of less than twenty percent of his or her subsistence allowance would not provide a reasonable amount for a dependent(s) claiming apportionment.

On other than original claims, apportionment will be effective the day following the date of last payment of the claimant's subsistence allowance, if a claim for apportionment is received within one year after the claimant's subsistence allowance. It should be noted that for the purpose of effective date under 38 CFR 3.400(e), “original claim” refers to the effective date of the claimant's subsistence award, with a presumption that an apportionment claim is received before any subsistence allowance has been paid. The effective date for other than original claims refers to the date of receipt of the apportionment claim after subsistence allowance to the claimant has already been issued. The concept is to preclude creation of undue overpayment against the claimant if an apportionment is authorized. 4.

Adjusting the Claimant's Award Due to Loss of a Dependent(s) (Change Date November 7, 2013) In most situations, VA uses the end-of-month rule when adjusting a claimant's award to reflect loss of a dependent. Under this rule, VA continues to pay the claimant for the dependent through the end of the month in which the event that resulted in the loss took place. Accordingly, the effective date of the reduced rate is the first day of the month following the date of loss. An apportionment must be discontinued when the claimant's award is affected by either of the following: Discontinued for any reason.

A case manager may only authorize an EAA payment for a claimant who has satisfactorily followed a program of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) approved employment services under 38 U.S.C. 3104(a)(5).  This means that a claimant's case must have progressed through Rehabilitation to the Point of Employability (RTE) status to Job Ready (JR) status following the provision of services under an Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP).  There must be a documented declaration of job-readiness by the Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) in the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) record at the time the claimant's case is placed in JR status. The claimant must satisfactorily participate in employment services for a period of 30 days before a payment of EAA may be authorized.  If authorized, EAA will be processed at the full-time rate for the type of program the claimant was last pursuing.  If a claimant, who is receiving the P911SA rate, has relocated to a new area after completing their last term of training, the zip code of the training facility that the claimant last attended must be used when processing EAAs.  In addition, if the claimant was attending training solely online during their last term of training and was receiving the P911SA rate, the EAA payment will be equal to 1/2 the national BAH average. If a claimant has been determined rehabilitated to the point of employability after completing an IWRP that did not include an official training component at a VA approved facility, EAA shall be paid at the improvement of rehabilitation potential rate as indicated in 38 CFR 21.260.

Examples of these services include, but are not limited to, interview skills training, job seeking techniques, resume development, assistance with translating military experience into civilian experience, and healthcare services. Since the program of employment services is subject to the 12-year eligibility period, or any extension of this period allowed under 38 U.S.C. 3103(b), (c), or (d), the EAA may only be paid for authorized periods within the eligibility period.",380,"M28C.V.B.9 Employment Adjustment Allowance

M28C.V.B.9 Employment Adjustment Allowance,9.03  Authorizing Employment Adjustment Allowance,"a. Criteria for Authorization (Change Date December 18, 2020) The case manager may authorize an EAA payment only after the criteria for EAA payments, addressed in section 9.02 of this chapter, have been verified and the claimant's VR&E record has been updated with the change to JR status. Additionally, the case manager must ensure that two previous EAA payments have not already been paid to the claimant. The case manager must not authorize an EAA payment in advance, or prior to the end of the 30-day period. However, EAA should be authorized as soon as there is documented evidence that the claimant is entitled to payment, but not later than 10 business days after receipt of documentation that supports authorization of an EAA payment. The case manager must authorize payment for EAA in two separate 30-day periods. Generally, these are consecutive payments. However, under certain circumstances, the claimant may not meet the requirements for the second payment immediately following the first one. If a claimant's Chapter 31 Payment History reflects that the claimant has an existing debt, the case manager must inform the claimant that the EAA payment will be processed; however, he or she may not receive the payment, or may receive partial payment, as the EAA may be applied to the debt. This notification must be documented in an electronic case note. b. Processing Employment Adjustment Allowance Payments (Change Date November 7, 2013) The case manager must process all EAA payments in the subsistence allowance module (SAM). Please reference the awards processing section of the CWINRS User Guide for guidance on how to process these payments. If a claimant has dependents, they must be added to an EAA payment in the same manner as the payment of subsistence allowance in a normal training period, as outlined in M28C.V.B.7. c.

Specific rates for the following types of training programs are detailed in 38 CFR 21.260: Institution of Higher Learning (IHL), Farm Cooperative, Apprenticeship, Non-paid Work Experience (NPWE), On-job training (OJT) at no or nominal pay in a Federal agency, Training in the Home Program, Independent Instructor Program, Cooperative Program, and Improvement of Rehabilitation Potential. EAA must be paid at the rate in effect for the period being authorized. If rate of payment of the EAA changes during an authorized period, such as change in the number of a claimant's dependents or increase in an annual cost of living (COLA), this change must be reflected in an electronic case note. Example: The period of EAA authorization is from 9/15 through 10/15. EAA will be paid at the previous rate from 9/15 through 9/30, and at the new rate from 10/01 through 10/15, to adjust for COLA. 2.

a. Criteria for Authorization (Change Date December 18, 2020) The case manager may authorize an EAA payment only after the criteria for EAA payments, addressed in section 9.02 of this chapter, have been verified and the claimant's VR&E record has been updated with the change to JR status. Additionally, the case manager must ensure that two previous EAA payments have not already been paid to the claimant. The case manager must not authorize an EAA payment in advance, or prior to the end of the 30-day period. However, EAA should be authorized as soon as there is documented evidence that the claimant is entitled to payment, but not later than 10 business days after receipt of documentation that supports authorization of an EAA payment. The case manager must authorize payment for EAA in two separate 30-day periods. Generally, these are consecutive payments. However, under certain circumstances, the claimant may not meet the requirements for the second payment immediately following the first one. If a claimant's Chapter 31 Payment History reflects that the claimant has an existing debt, the case manager must inform the claimant that the EAA payment will be processed; however, he or she may not receive the payment, or may receive partial payment, as the EAA may be applied to the debt. This notification must be documented in an electronic case note. b. Processing Employment Adjustment Allowance Payments (Change Date November 7, 2013) The case manager must process all EAA payments in the subsistence allowance module (SAM). Please reference the awards processing section of the CWINRS User Guide for guidance on how to process these payments.

EAA must be paid at the rate in effect for the period being authorized. If rate of payment of the EAA changes during an authorized period, such as change in the number of a claimant's dependents or increase in an annual cost of living (COLA), this change must be reflected in an electronic case note.

Claimant Requests to Extend Travel (Change Date November 7, 2013) If the claimant wishes to return home later than the scheduled date, the claimant must be informed that VA will not reimburse lodging and meal costs from the last date of service to the date of return to his or her home. The costs will be at the claimant's expense. In accordance with 38 CFR 21.372, all return travel must be made from the location in which VA furnished the service to the claimant's home. If the claimant travels to another location, return travel to the claimant's home may be from that point only if the travel costs are less than the Government would pay for travel from the site of the service. If the cost of travel to another location exceeds the claimant's return to his or her home, he or she is responsible for paying the excess amount. d. VA Requests to Extend Travel (Change Date November 7, 2013) VA may request to extend the claimant's travel in order to provide enough time to receive all necessary services associated with the scheduled appointment. For example, a claimant's stay in the U.S. may be extended to complete the development of his or her rehabilitation plan. If the claimant's stay needs to be extended beyond the anticipated date of return, VA is responsible for all additional costs related to the extension. e.

M28C.V.C.2 Incarcerated and Fugitive Felon Claimants,2.02  Fugitive Felon Claimants,"(Change Date June 23, 2014) 38 U.S.C. 5313B precludes VA from providing VR&E services to claimants and dependents of claimants who are fugitive felons. A fugitive felon is a person who is: Fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction, for an offense, or an attempt to commit an offense, which is a felony under the laws of the place from which the person flees; or Violating a condition of probation or parole imposed for commission of a felony under Federal or State law. VA no longer presumes that any valid outstanding felony arrest warrant establishes a claimant's fugitive felon status. a. VA's Office of the Inspector General Actions (Change Date June 23, 2014) VA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has primary responsibility for the implementation of the fugitive felon provisions of section 505 of Public Law 107-103. The OIG identifies VA beneficiaries who may be fugitive felons by matching lists of fugitives from Federal and state law enforcement authorities to VA records. b. Regional Office Actions (Change Date June 23, 2014) The VR&E Officer serves as the regional office's (RO) primary point of contact (POC) for handling referrals. The VR&E Officer should select an alternate POC to serve in his or her absence. Both POCs must have Level 7 sensitive access. The POCs must, when appropriate, coordinate with OIG Fugitive Felon Coordinator to obtain information or evidence to resolve the referrals. When VR&E is aware that a claimant has a felony warrant with an offense code indicating flight or a probation or parole violation, VR&E will notify the claimant of the warrant, as well as the proposal to terminate benefits. VR&E will provide the claimant with 60 days to respond with evidence indicating that the warrant was entered in error, pertains to a different person, or was vacated by the issuing court. VR&E will determine whether the claimant is or was a fugitive felon based on all the evidence and facts found.

2.02  Fugitive Felon Claimants

(Change Date June 23, 2014) 38 U.S.C. 5313B precludes VA from providing VR&E services to claimants and dependents of claimants who are fugitive felons. A fugitive felon is a person who is: Fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction, for an offense, or an attempt to commit an offense, which is a felony under the laws of the place from which the person flees; or Violating a condition of probation or parole imposed for commission of a felony under Federal or State law. VA no longer presumes that any valid outstanding felony arrest warrant establishes a claimant's fugitive felon status. a. VA's Office of the Inspector General Actions (Change Date June 23, 2014) VA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has primary responsibility for the implementation of the fugitive felon provisions of section 505 of Public Law 107-103. The OIG identifies VA beneficiaries who may be fugitive felons by matching lists of fugitives from Federal and state law enforcement authorities to VA records. b. Regional Office Actions (Change Date June 23, 2014) The VR&E Officer serves as the regional office's (RO) primary point of contact (POC) for handling referrals. The VR&E Officer should select an alternate POC to serve in his or her absence. Both POCs must have Level 7 sensitive access. The POCs must, when appropriate, coordinate with OIG Fugitive Felon Coordinator to obtain information or evidence to resolve the referrals. When VR&E is aware that a claimant has a felony warrant with an offense code indicating flight or a probation or parole violation, VR&E will notify the claimant of the warrant, as well as the proposal to terminate benefits. VR&E will provide the claimant with 60 days to respond with evidence indicating that the warrant was entered in error, pertains to a different person, or was vacated by the issuing court. VR&E will determine whether the claimant is or was a fugitive felon based on all the evidence and facts found. To ensure proper receipt of all correspondences, the VRC must confirm where mail should be sent during this time. This letter should include the types of information that VR&E will accept when determining fugitive felon status. VR&E will discontinue benefits and create an overpayment, applicable, based on fugitive felon status only if: A judge issued a felony arrest warrant with a National Crime Information Center (NCIC) offense code indicating flight or a probation or parole violation, VR&E provided the claimant notice regarding the reason for the warrant and an opportunity to present evidence, such as an acknowledgement of the validity of the warrant or failure to respond to the due process notification, or that he or she did not flee from justice or did not violate any condition of probation or parole, and VR&E determines, based upon the warrant and evidence submitted by the claimant (if any), that the claimant was fleeing from justice or violated a condition of probation or parole. The case manager must inform the claimant in writing of this discontinuance and/or overpayment, via VR (insert#), Fugitive Felon Post-Determination Letter – Notice of Adverse Action.

Selection of Service Providers (Change Date August 1, 2012) Contracts are awarded at a national level.

Receiving the services from a public-sector or not-for-profit agency would constitute a hardship for the claimant.
The VA cannot obtain comparable services cost-effectively from other sources, such as public-sector or not-for-profit agencies.

Disabled Veterans' Outreach Program (DVOP) specialists and Local Veterans' Employment Representatives (LVER) may also perform this function. 2. Authorities for Veterans and Individuals with Disabilities (Change Date August 1, 2012) The most common authorities available to hiring managers, HR personnel, Veterans and individuals with disabilities are listed and described below: (a) Veterans' Recruitment Appointment (VRA) gives agencies the discretion to appoint eligible Veterans to positions in the federal government without competition. Veterans may be appointed to any grade level in the General Schedule through GS-11 or equivalent. This authority also allows applicants with disabilities rated at 30 percent or more or rated at 10 or 20 percent and determined to have a “serious employment handicap” to be employed by VA as Veterans benefits counselors, Veterans claims examiners, Veterans representatives at educational institutions and counselors at readjustment centers. Applicants must meet the basic qualifications for the position to be filled. (1) General Information (Change Date August 1, 2012) VRA is an excepted service authority that allows agencies to appoint eligible Veterans without competition. Veterans can be appointed under this authority at any grade level up to and including GS-11 or equivalent (promotion potential of the position is not a factor). This authority also allows applicants with disabilities rated at 30 percent or more or rated at 10 or 20 percent and determined to have a “serious employment handicap” to be employed by VA as Veterans benefits counselors, Veterans claims examiners, Veterans representatives at educational institutions and counselors at readjustment centers. This special appointing authority is a good tool for filling entry-level to mid-level positions. (2) Appointment Options (Change Date August 1, 2012) In most cases,","1. What is Veterans' Preference?

In accordance with 5 CFR 307.103, after successfully completing two years of employment, Veterans must be converted to a career or career-conditional appointment in the competitive service. Agencies can use VRA to fill noncompetitive temporary (not to exceed one year) or term (more than one year but not to exceed four years) positions based on an individual's eligibility for VRA. The temporary or term appointment must be at the grades authorized for VRA but is not a VRA itself and does not lead to conversion to the competitive service. For Veterans on temporary appointments, the agencies may extend the temporary appointments for one additional year for a total of 24 months. Term appointments may be extended within the one-to-four-year period according to the employing agencies' procedures. Agencies may request approval of an extension beyond the four years of a term appointment from OPM. At the conclusion of the temporary or term appointment and extension, if needed, Veterans may be considered for new jobs or other VRAs, provided they qualify. (3) Requirements (Change Date August 1, 2012) Requirements of this special appointing authority are as follows: (1) No vacancy announcement is required. Possible recruitment options include but are not limited to the following: Veterans may contact agencies and submit resumes and supporting documentation to the agencies' Veterans Employment Program Managers (VEPMs), Special Placement Program Coordinators (SPPCs), HR personnel, or hiring managers. Hiring managers and HR personnel may receive resume referrals from their agencies' VEPMs and SPPCs, VR&E and other outside resources. (2) Veterans' preference applies under 5 CFR 302.201 and 211 when using this authority. (3) Specific eligibility requirements for this authority are provided in 38 U.S.C. 4214 and 5 CFR 307. (4) Agency-prescribed education/training is required for Veterans with less than 15 years of education.

This special appointing authority is a good tool for filling positions at any grade level quickly. Another key feature of this authority is the ability for federal employers to convert Veterans under this authority from a temporary appointment to permanent status after a relatively brief period of employment.

If the claimant is determined eligible and currently attending the VSOC campus, local VR&E staff will provide the PCPG benefits directly as the contract under 38 U.S.C. 3697 is not available to VR&E. If the claimant is determined ineligible, local VR&E staff must process the application using the AutoGED process and use one of the reason codes (RC) listed in section 1.03.d.1 below to identify how the application was received. The case will then be moved from applicant status to “closed without counseling” using RC 130, case closed by VSOC counselor, or RC 131, case closed by VRC. RC 130 must be used if the case is being closed by a VSOC counselor and RC 131 must be used if the case is being closed by a local VR&E staff member other than a VSOC counselor. After selecting RC 130 or 131, the detailed reason code (DRC) K, ineligible (PCPG/Ch36), must be selected. The claimant must also be sent VR-69, Chapter 36 Decision Letter, to include VAF 20-0998.

Note: Regardless of whether the claimant is eligible or ineligible, when local VR&E staff process a paper version of VAF 28-8832 and provide the applicable services, the application must be sent to the folder scanning vendor, with the statement written on the top of the application “Services already provided by VR&E”, to be uploaded to the electronic record and not the centralized mail vendor. Sending it to the centralized mail vendor will produce a duplicate application sent to OTED, which is not necessary since VR&E has provided or is providing the PCPG services already.

An appointment letter is not necessary for unscheduled walk-ins, such as at a VSOC site, however this must be documented in an electronic case note using the “PCPG/Chapter 36” case note category. The claimant must also be informed that he or she is eligible for PCPG benefits.

Therefore, from the time the OTED and VR&E partnership begins, there will likely be three different phases pertaining to the use of computer systems. The first phase will be when both Chapter 31 and Chapter 36 are in CWINRS, the second phase will be when Chapter 31 is in CMS and Chapter 36 is in CWINRS, and the last phase will be when both Chapter 31 and Chapter 36 are in CMS. This chapter only addresses the first two phases as procedures will be developed for when both programs are in CMS at a later date.

A major difference is that it is not necessary for the VRC to make a determination regarding Employment Handicap (EH) and Serious Employment Handicap (SEH) for entitlement reasons. Entitlement is based solely on the determination of feasibility. However, the VRC must still address the presence of an EH/SEH for planning purposes. This information will ensure that the VRC, as well as the claimant, have a complete understanding of the impact of the functional limitations resulting from the claimant's disability will have on the vocational goal, and ensure that those issues are addressed in the rehabilitation plan. For additional information on the determination of EH/SEH, see M28C.IV.B.1. a. Determination of Feasibility (Change Date July 2, 2014) 38 CFR 21.8020 states that for an individual to be entitled to receive vocational training, employment assistance and related rehabilitation services and assistance to achieve a vocational goal under Chapter 18, the VRC must determine that it is reasonably feasible for the individual to achieve a vocational goal. This process is comparable to the determination of feasibility for a claimant of Chapter 31 services. It is important to note that the claimant has the right to appeal the feasibility determination. See M28C.IV.B.1 for procedural guidance on how to determine feasibility. b. Outcome of Evaluation 1. Achievement of a Vocational Goal is Reasonably Feasible (Change Date July 2, 2014) If the VRC determines that reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal exists, the VRC will work with the claimant to: Identify a suitable vocational goal, Select a training facility, if training is needed, Develop a plan of services, and Address any barriers to participation in the program. 2. Reasonable Feasibility to Achieve a Vocational Goal is in Question (Change Date July 2, 2014) If the VRC determines that reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal is questionable, the VRC will obtain additional diagnostic information necessary to make a feasibility determination. To do this, the VRC must work with the claimant to develop a plan of services through an Individual Extended Evaluation Plan (IEEP). If a period of work adjustment services is needed to assist with this determination, 38 CFR 21.8032 limits work adjustment services to 30 days. See M28C.IV.C.3 for procedural guidance on the development of an IEEP. 3.

Plan Types Available under Chapter 18 The following types of plans are available for use in Chapter 18 services: 1. Individualized Extended Evaluation Plan (IEEP) (Change Date July 2, 2014) In instances where it is not immediately clear if the achievement of a vocational goal is currently reasonably feasible, VR&E provides a period of extended evaluation. During this period, the VRC and claimant develop a plan of services designed to determine feasibility. It is important to note that with the strict limitation on the duration of Chapter 18 services, the VRC needs to be sure that the claimant will have enough time to complete the extended evaluation period, as well as the expected time in training. As such, 38 CFR 21.8140 limits extended evaluation services for Chapter 18 claimants to no longer than nine full-time months, or the part-time equivalent.

Discontinued (Change Date December 27, 2012) If the claimant decides not to pursue services; does not respond to attempts by the VRC to participate in the rehabilitation plan; and/or does not complete his or her rehabilitation plan as anticipated, discontinuation of the case may be necessary.  The VRC may terminate services provided under Chapter 18 under the following circumstances: If the claimant fails to cooperate in the evaluation, training or employment process, the VRC will terminate any training services by VR&E the first calendar day of the next full month that occurs 30 days after notification of proposed termination.  For example, proposed termination is sent March 12, 30 days later is April 11, terminate award May 1.
If eligibility or entitlement to services was established through fraud, the VRC will terminate training services by VR&E as of the date VA first began to pay benefits.
If eligibility or entitlement was awarded through administrative error, the VRC will terminate training services by VR&E the first calendar day of the next full month which occurs 30 days after notification of proposed termination.  For example, error is discovered, and proposed termination sent March 12, 30 days later is April 11, terminate award May 1.

Data Collection (Change Date December 27, 2012) While rehabilitation determinations for Chapter 18 claims appear in the positive outcomes report, the VR&E Officer, or designee, can also access this information from CWINRS by completing the following steps: Go to Case Management module.
Go to the Folder Selection screen.
Choose Chapter 18 (as the benefit type).
Choose Rehabilitated (Case Status).
Switch the archived section to “Archived Cases”.
Input the date range.
Click Apply. VR&E Service will request this information on a quarterly basis via email for a Congressionally mandated report. b.  Discontinued (Change Date December 27, 2012) If the claimant decides not to pursue services; does not respond to attempts by the VRC to participate in the rehabilitation plan; and/or does not complete his or her rehabilitation plan as anticipated, discontinuation of the case may be necessary.  The VRC may terminate services provided under Chapter 18 under the following circumstances: If the claimant fails to cooperate in the evaluation, training or employment process, the VRC will terminate any training services by VR&E the first calendar day of the next full month that occurs 30 days after notification of proposed termination.  For example, proposed termination is sent March 12, 30 days later is April 11, terminate award May 1.
If eligibility or entitlement to services was established through fraud, the VRC will terminate training services by VR&E as of the date VA first began to pay benefits.
If eligibility or entitlement was awarded through administrative error, the VRC will terminate training services by VR&E the first calendar day of the next full month which occurs 30 days after notification of proposed termination.  For example, error is discovered, and proposed termination sent March 12, 30 days later is April 11, terminate award May 1.
If VA finds the claimant no longer has a covered birth defect, the VRC will terminate any training services by VR&E effective the last day of the month, during which that determination becomes final.  For example, determination becomes final March 12, terminate award March 31. See M28C.V.A.6 for information on the discontinuation process.   Back to Top of Page","1.

The STAR review sample is based on a statistical formula, which considers the workload and accuracy scores for the past two fiscal years for each RO, as well as the agreed upon statistical confidence level and margin of error. The Local QA sample is based on the number of reviews required per the performance standards for each case manager.  It is vital that the RO update Workforce Information Tool (WIT) and send an email to the QA Mailbox when there are changes to case managers so OPA&I can be alerted to make changes to the Local QA sample.

1.05  Quality Assurance Compliance Sampling Methodology

(Change Date May 1, 2019) OPA&I randomly selects a sample of cases for the STAR and Local QA reviews, based on the business rules established in collaboration with VR&E Service.  The STAR review sample is based on a statistical formula, which considers the workload and accuracy scores for the past two fiscal years for each RO, as well as the agreed upon statistical confidence level and margin of error. The Local QA sample is based on the number of reviews required per the performance standards for each case manager.  It is vital that the RO update Workforce Information Tool (WIT) and send an email to the QA Mailbox when there are changes to case managers so OPA&I can be alerted to make changes to the Local QA sample. The sample for both Local QA and National STAR reviews is based on the workload at the end of the month prior to selection.  For example, the April 2020 selection is based on the workload at the end of March 2020. OPA&I provides VR&E Service with a list of cases selected for STAR and Local QA review.

The QA reviewer must refer to the corresponding Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for guidance when conducting a case review. Although QA Reviewers must guard against making assumptions when reviewing a case, professional judgment must sometimes be used. 3. Citing an Error (Change Date November 30, 2017) When conducting a review, the QA Reviewer must refer to the SOP for the type of review being conducted for guidance. Each review instrument includes multiple questions that must be answered when reviewing the case. If the answer to the question is “No” this indicates an error. When citing an error, the QA Reviewer has determined that the action or decision does not meet the intent of the laws, regulations, policies, procedures or other guidance for providing VR&E services. 4. Selecting a Reason (Change Date November 30, 2017) Some questions have multiple reasons for which an error may be cited. If an error is cited by answering “No” to one of these questions, at least one reason must be selected. Reasons are numbered A, B, C, etc. These provide more specific detail about the error to help identify trends and the need for clarification or training. 5. Adding Notes (Change Date November 30, 2017) In QAWeb, the QA Reviewer can add notes at the question and/or reason level to provide further clarification or specifics about the error cited. Adding notes is optional as some questions or reasons do not require further clarification. 6. Grace Period for Implementation of New or Revised Policy (Change Date November 26, 2013) All VR&E Officers must ensure that appropriate training is provided to staff members within 90 calendar days from the date of implementation to ensure effective application of new or revised policies. VR&E offices are provided a grace period of 90 calendar days from the effective date of each new or revised policy unless otherwise specified. The effective date may be the date of the letter or the date of implementation as specified in the letter. Within the grace period, no errors are cited on the issue(s) related to the new or revised policy. However, the identified issue may be marked as “Notice of Future Error” in the General Comments section of the review. e. General Comments (Change Date November 30, 2017) Each QA review instrument includes an optional General Comments section at the bottom of the page. This section is used to provide notes and comments when an error is not cited but a comment needs to be made. For example, this section may be used when an error is discovered but it is outside the review period or scope of the review. It may also be used when an error isn't cited, but there is something the QA Reviewer wants to draw attention to, such as something that needs to be corrected to avoid a potential future error. f.

The analyses must be valid and reliable to ensure that the results accurately represent the element or process being examined, and that a separate analysis would result in consistent findings. a. Components of a Strategic Oversight and Analysis Review The critical factors in executing an effective SOAR consist of the following: 1. Selecting a Random Sample (Change Date March 31, 2014) Randomly select samples of cases to ensure validity and reliability of results. A percentage of the workload must be taken to select a sample size of the total workload for a specified category. This could be performed by selecting at least 10 percent , or a portion of the total workload for a specified category. For example, if there are 136 cases in Job Ready (JR) status and there is only one assigned case manager, select 14 cases or 10 percent of the cases for analysis. However, if there are three case managers with approximately equal caseloads, increase the selection count to 15 cases and randomly select five cases for each case manager for analysis. Note: The 10 percent selection for random sampling is merely a suggested percentage when obtaining a valid random sampling. An alternative sample size or percentage of the specific caseload may be selected to ensure that the random sampling is valid. Research randomizers may be used to identify samples using an array of data quickly and randomly. The randomizers are effective tools that can be found by conducting a search on the internet. 2. Creating an Audit Trail (Change Date March 31, 2014) An audit trail is a method that tracks the detailed data and worksheets related to each SOAR record. This includes electronic spreadsheets used for the analysis and the actual SOAR reports. It allows replication of a specific analysis of an element in the SOAR. The results can be validated by an RO management analyst, VA Central Office, or other auditors. Each VR&E office must maintain completed analyses as outlined in the Records Control Schedule (RCS), VB-1, Part I, Item 13-098.000. All data and worksheets used in each analysis for two years following the resolution of any problems identified within the analyses must be maintained in a Sharepoint or other designated electronic folder assigned by the RO Director. 3.

The QA reviews must have been conducted within the 12-month period prior to the date of the analysis. For example, the QA review data for an analysis in December 2021 will include data from QA reviews conducted no earlier than December 2020.
